Alternosema bostrichidis,"Ultrastructure, molecular phylogeny, and prevalence rates of Alternosema bostrichidis gen. nov. sp. nov. (Microsporidia, Terresporidia), a parasite of Prostephanus truncatus and Dinoderus spp. (Coleoptera, Bostrichidae)","Ultrastructure, molecular phylogeny, and prevalence rates of Alternosema bostrichidis gen. nov. sp. nov. (Microsporidia, Terresporidia), a parasite of Prostephanus truncatus and Dinoderus spp. (Coleoptera, Bostrichidae) ::: A new species and a new genus of a microsporidium Alternosema bostrichidis isolated from an adult Prostephanus truncatus in Mexico and from three species of the genus Dinoderus in Nigeria are described. The microsporidium is monomorphic, monoxenic, and develops in direct contact with host cell cytoplasm. The infection first appears with thoracic muscles, followed by a generalized invasion of the host. All developmental stages are diplokaryotic. Sporogony is disporoblastic. Mature spores are ovoid. Unfixed spores measure 3.7–4.2 × 2.0–2.6 μm, fixed and stained spores 3.5–5.0 × 2.4–2.8 μm. The polaroplast consists of dense lamellae and rare lamellae. The polar tube is slightly anisofilar, consisting of 11–17 coils, with 9–14 proximal (130 nm in diameter) and 2–3 distal coils (120 nm in diameter) arranged in one layer. Molecular phylogenetic analysis based upon a short portion of small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene (Genbank accession # KP455651) placed the new microsporidium within Liebermannia-Orthosomella lineage, which contains multiple undescribed parasites. In particular, A. bostrichidis showed maximal sequence similarity of 95% to Microsporidium sp. BBRE2 (# FJ755987) from Baikalian Diplacanthus brevispinus (Amphipoda: Acanthogammaridae) and Microsporidium sp. Comp CD Van 2 (# KC111784) from compost and soil in Canada. Frequent, devastating epizootics of laboratory cultures of A. bostrichidis support its potential as a biological control agent of grain borers.",Prostephanus truncatus; Dinoderus bifoveolatus; Dinoderus porcellus; Dinoderus minutus,NA,Dinoderus bifoveolatus; Dinoderus porcellus; Dinoderus minutus,NA

Meiospores of all species exhibited characteristics typical for the genus Amblyospora including: a single nucleus, a large posterior vacuole, a thick undulating exospore and thinner endospore, a bipartite and lamellate polaroplast with more tightly stacked membranes in the proximal region, and an anisofilar polar filament with distal coils reduced in thickness. Distinct differences were found in the arrangement and number/ ratio of coils formed by the broad basal and narrow distal portions of the polar filament. These differences, when quantified and averaged, were unique from all other mosquito‐parasitic species that have been examined ultrastructurally. Information on parasite development, natural field prevalence and transmission to suspected intermediate copepod hosts is presented. The creation of six new species, Amblyospora abserrati, Amblyospora auriferi, Amblyospora cinerei, Amblyospora excrucii, Amblyospora stictici, and Amblyospora stimuli is proposed.

Amblyospora bakcharia,Ultrastructural characterization and comparative phylogenetic analysis of new microsporidia from Siberian mosquitoes: Evidence for coevolution and host switching,"Ultrastructural characterization and comparative phylogenetic analysis of new microsporidia from Siberian mosquitoes: Evidence for coevolution and host switching ::: Graphical abstract Highlights ► New species of microsporidia are described from Siberian mosquitoes. ► Unique meiospore ultrastructure and SSU rDNA sequences were obtained. ► Phylogenetic trees show a high degree of congruence between parasite and host at the generic level. ► Tree topologies imply cospeciation, host switching and independent parasite speciation. Abstract A survey of mosquito larvae infected with microsporidia was conducted from 2005 to 2008 in the Tomsk, Kemerovo and Novosibirsk regions of western Siberia, Russia. Twenty-one morphologically and genetically unique species of microsporidia were isolated from nine species of Anopheles, Aedes, Culex and Ochlerotatus mosquitoes including: (1) 14 proposed new species of Amblyospora (A. bakcharia, A. baritia, A. bogashovia, A. chulymia, A. hristinia, A. jurginia, A. kazankia, A. mavlukevia, A. mocrushinia, A. modestium, A. salairia, A. severinia, A. shegaria, and A. timirasia); (2) a newly proposed genus and species, Novothelohania ovalae and; (3) six species of Amblyospora (A. flavescens, A. kolarovi, A. rugosa), Parathelohania (P. divulgata and P. tomski) and Trichoctosporea (T. pygopellita) from which gene sequences had not been previously obtained. Detailed ultrastructure of meiospores revealed unique cytological features associated with the length, arrangement and ratio of broad to narrow coils of the polar filament, comparative thickness of the exospore and endospore, and overall size of each species reaffirming their value in distinguishing taxonomic relationships. SSU rDNA sequences obtained from each species of microsporidia were unique when compared with GenBank entries. Phylogenetic trees constructed by Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Neighbor Joining analyses yielded similar topologies with a high degree of congruence between parasite and host at the generic level. Species that parasitize Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Culex mosquitoes segregate into distinct monophyletic groupings mirroring their host phylogeny, while species from Anopheles mosquitoes group as a sister clade basal to the entire group of mosquito-parasitic microsporidia as their Anopheles hosts cluster as a sister clade to the entire group of culicine mosquitoes. This provides strong evidence for host-parasite coevolution by descent at the generic level and limited host lineage switching between unrelated taxa. Among parasites of Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Anopheles mosquitoes, we found several instances where a single mosquito species serves as a host for two or more related species of microsporidia, an observation consistent with host switching and independent parasite speciation. Among the microsporidian parasites of Culex mosquitoes, we found only one parasite per host indicating a higher degree of host specificity and less host switching among parasites of this genus. Findings suggest a degree of host-parasite co-speciation with host switching occurring occasionally when the “normal” host is unavailable in the aquatic ecosystem.

Amblyospora hristinia,Ultrastructural characterization and comparative phylogenetic analysis of new microsporidia from Siberian mosquitoes: Evidence for coevolution and host switching,"Ultrastructural characterization and comparative phylogenetic analysis of new microsporidia from Siberian mosquitoes: Evidence for coevolution and host switching ::: Graphical abstract Highlights ► New species of microsporidia are described from Siberian mosquitoes. ► Unique meiospore ultrastructure and SSU rDNA sequences were obtained. ► Phylogenetic trees show a high degree of congruence between parasite and host at the generic level. ► Tree topologies imply cospeciation, host switching and independent parasite speciation. Abstract A survey of mosquito larvae infected with microsporidia was conducted from 2005 to 2008 in the Tomsk, Kemerovo and Novosibirsk regions of western Siberia, Russia. Twenty-one morphologically and genetically unique species of microsporidia were isolated from nine species of Anopheles, Aedes, Culex and Ochlerotatus mosquitoes including: (1) 14 proposed new species of Amblyospora (A. bakcharia, A. baritia, A. bogashovia, A. chulymia, A. hristinia, A. jurginia, A. kazankia, A. mavlukevia, A. mocrushinia, A. modestium, A. salairia, A. severinia, A. shegaria, and A. timirasia); (2) a newly proposed genus and species, Novothelohania ovalae and; (3) six species of Amblyospora (A. flavescens, A. kolarovi, A. rugosa), Parathelohania (P. divulgata and P. tomski) and Trichoctosporea (T. pygopellita) from which gene sequences had not been previously obtained. Detailed ultrastructure of meiospores revealed unique cytological features associated with the length, arrangement and ratio of broad to narrow coils of the polar filament, comparative thickness of the exospore and endospore, and overall size of each species reaffirming their value in distinguishing taxonomic relationships. SSU rDNA sequences obtained from each species of microsporidia were unique when compared with GenBank entries. Phylogenetic trees constructed by Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Neighbor Joining analyses yielded similar topologies with a high degree of congruence between parasite and host at the generic level. Species that parasitize Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Culex mosquitoes segregate into distinct monophyletic groupings mirroring their host phylogeny, while species from Anopheles mosquitoes group as a sister clade basal to the entire group of mosquito-parasitic microsporidia as their Anopheles hosts cluster as a sister clade to the entire group of culicine mosquitoes. This provides strong evidence for host-parasite coevolution by descent at the generic level and limited host lineage switching between unrelated taxa. Among parasites of Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Anopheles mosquitoes, we found several instances where a single mosquito species serves as a host for two or more related species of microsporidia, an observation consistent with host switching and independent parasite speciation. Among the microsporidian parasites of Culex mosquitoes, we found only one parasite per host indicating a higher degree of host specificity and less host switching among parasites of this genus. Findings suggest a degree of host-parasite co-speciation with host switching occurring occasionally when the “normal” host is unavailable in the aquatic ecosystem. Frequency of host switching seems to be occurring in proportion to host relatedness and does not cross generic boundaries in this system.",Ochlerotatus communis,NA,Ochlerotatus communis,NA

Abstract A survey of mosquito larvae infected with microsporidia was conducted from 2005 to 2008 in the Tomsk, Kemerovo and Novosibirsk regions of western Siberia, Russia. Twenty-one morphologically and genetically unique species of microsporidia were isolated from nine species of Anopheles, Aedes, Culex and Ochlerotatus mosquitoes including: (1) 14 proposed new species of Amblyospora (A. bakcharia, A. baritia, A. bogashovia, A. chulymia, A. hristinia, A. jurginia, A. kazankia, A. mavlukevia, A. mocrushinia, A. modestium, A. salairia, A. severinia, A. shegaria, and A. timirasia); (2) a newly proposed genus and species, Novothelohania ovalae and; (3) six species of Amblyospora (A. flavescens, A. kolarovi, A. rugosa), Parathelohania (P. divulgata and P. tomski) and Trichoctosporea (T. pygopellita) from which gene sequences had not been previously obtained. Detailed ultrastructure of meiospores revealed unique cytological features associated with the length, arrangement and ratio of broad to narrow coils of the polar filament, comparative thickness of the exospore and endospore, and overall size of each species reaffirming their value in distinguishing taxonomic relationships. SSU rDNA sequences obtained from each species of microsporidia were unique when compared with GenBank entries. Phylogenetic trees constructed by Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Neighbor Joining analyses yielded similar topologies with a high degree of congruence between parasite and host at the generic level. Species that parasitize Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Culex mosquitoes segregate into distinct monophyletic groupings mirroring their host phylogeny, while species from Anopheles mosquitoes group as a sister clade basal to the entire group of mosquito-parasitic microsporidia as their Anopheles hosts cluster as a sister clade to the entire group of culicine mosquitoes.

SSU rDNA sequences obtained from each species of microsporidia were unique when compared with GenBank entries. Phylogenetic trees constructed by Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Neighbor Joining analyses yielded similar topologies with a high degree of congruence between parasite and host at the generic level. Species that parasitize Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Culex mosquitoes segregate into distinct monophyletic groupings mirroring their host phylogeny, while species from Anopheles mosquitoes group as a sister clade basal to the entire group of mosquito-parasitic microsporidia as their Anopheles hosts cluster as a sister clade to the entire group of culicine mosquitoes. This provides strong evidence for host-parasite coevolution by descent at the generic level and limited host lineage switching between unrelated taxa. Among parasites of Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Anopheles mosquitoes, we found several instances where a single mosquito species serves as a host for two or more related species of microsporidia, an observation consistent with host switching and independent parasite speciation. Among the microsporidian parasites of Culex mosquitoes, we found only one parasite per host indicating a higher degree of host specificity and less host switching among parasites of this genus. Findings suggest a degree of host-parasite co-speciation with host switching occurring occasionally when the “normal” host is unavailable in the aquatic ecosystem.

From most countries about a dozen samples and a few hundred beetles were inspected. A total of 13 910 individual beetles were checked under a compound microscope, and of these, 561 were found to be infected (4.03%). Despite careful examination, infection was not detectable in samples from the UK (1039 beetles inspected), Germany (694), Sweden (489), or Switzerland (280). One infected beetle was found among 444 beetles inspected from Austria, and one from Denmark (1/85). In contrast, the parasite was found rather regularly in samples from Finland and from Eastern European countries. No obvious reason for this pattern of infection is known, but pesticide usage at or close to the sampling sites may play a role, because most samples from which Nosema was detected originated from areas where few pesticides are used. Spore size measurements were made from seven N. meligethi isolates, and they appeared relatively uniform.

Development comprises 2 merogonial sequences, the first resulting in a cluster of 8 merozoites, the second in a chain of 4 merozoites. Each secondary merozoite develops into a sporont which divides into 2 sporoblasts, each of which develops into a spore. The spores are broadly oval and in fresh smears measure about 6 fim in length, with a single nucleus and a posterosome. The polar filament is about 40 fim long, of even thickness throughout, and appears as 15—18 coils in a single layer. The anchoring disc is small and the polaroplast is composed of 2 lamellar parts. Outside the plasma membrane of the sporont a 5-layered, electrondense substance is produced, which further differentiates into endo- and exospore, an electron-dense substance occurring patchily on the exospore and a pansporoblast membrane. During development the sporoblasts and the young spores are connected by a dense substance. Mature spores appear single or paired. The pansporoblast membrane is composed of 2 structurally different layers, namely a thin outer, single membrane and an inner layer composed of tubular structures. It is connected to the spore coat by patches of the dense substance. The new microsporidium is considered to belong to a new genus of the family Telomyxidae, and its systematic relationship with this and the related family Tuzetiidae is discussed. A survey of microsporidia from Cladocera is included.",Daphnia pulex,NA,Daphnia pulex,NA

(microspora, caudosporidae), a microsporidian parasite of ostracods of the genus Candona (crustacea, cyprididae) in Sweden ::: The microsporidium Binucleospora elongata n.g., n. sp., a parasite of ostracods of the genus Candona in Sweden, is described based on light microscopic and ultrastructural characteristics. Merogonial stages and sporonts are diplokaryotic. Rounded merogonial Plasmodia produce at least 8 diplokaryotic merozoites by plasmotomy. Sporogonial Plasmodia, with 16–32 diplokarya, are initially rounded, but the shape changes to ribbon-like prior to the release of sporoblasts. The close association between the nuclei breaks at the end of the sporogony. The fragile sporophorous vesicle breaks when the spores are mature. The binucleate spores are rod-shaped, slightly curved, and measure approximately 2 × 5-6.8 μm in living condition. The exospore is two-layered with an internal double membrane-like layer and a cover of granular material. The isofilar polar filament is arranged in 11–14 irregular coils in the posterior half of the spore. The polaroplast has three regions: narrow, closely packed lamellae anteriorly, wider lamellae in the median region, and posterior tubuli. The nuclei are enveloped in multiple layers of smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The microsporidium is compared to the microsporidia of Ostracoda, and its possible relations to the genera Octosporea, Pseudopleistophora and Perezia are discussed. The new genus is provisionally included in the family Caudosporidae.",Candona sp.,NA,Candona sp.,Candona

It infects most tissues of adult male and female mosquitoes, destroying the midgut, Malpighian tubules, the fat body, muscles, hypoderm and connective tissues. It is usually transmitted with feces released by mosquitoes during feeding on cotton swabs with honey water. In sporogony the oval binucleate spores, 2.5-3 x 1.5-2 μm, have an anisofilar polar filament coiled in 9 coils in one row. Five anterior coils are of larger diameter than the posterior three to four. Macrospores 3-4 x 2 μm form a low percentage of mature spores (1:30). Tubulovesicular secretions are present.",Anopheles gambiae; Anopheles melas,NA,Anopheles melas,A. melas

Biopsied muscle tissue, examined by light and electron microscopy, revealed the presence of organisms developing in direct contact with muscle cell cytoplasm and fibers. No other tissue types were infected. All parasite stages contain diplokaryotic nuclei and all cell division is by binary fission. Sporogony is disporoblastic, producing 2.9 x 2 microns diplokaryotic spores containing 8-10 coils of the polar filament arranged in one to three rows, usually two. Additionally, this microsporidium produces electron-dense extracellular secretions and vesiculotubular appendages similar to Nosema algerae. However, the production of protoplasmic extensions which may branch and terminate in extensive vesiculotubular structures is unique to this parasite. Additionally, unlike Nosema algerae, its development occurred at warm blooded host temperature (37-38 degrees C) and unlike Nosema connori, which disseminates to all tissue types, B. vesicularum infected only muscle cells.

Analysis of available molecular data (ITS region and partial ssu and lsu rDNA) of these parasites indicates that many microsporidia infecting daphnids have a common ancestor and represent a large clade, which splits during evolution into a number of well supported subclades. These subclades are cytologically different but may be most conveniently characterised by their specific ITS barcode. We have analysed one of these subclades and we describe a new microsporidian genus and species combination, and assemble a large group of structurally indistinguishable microsporidian parasites that infect adipose cells of their hosts and form pyriform spores of a certain type (“obtuse spores”). Obtuse spores are non-infectious by feeding to their crustacean hosts and it is plausible that microsporidia forming them actually are parasites of insects with aquatic larval stages, with an obligate two-host life cycle, analogous to the Amblyospora life cycle involving copepods and mosquitoes.",Daphnia pulex,NA,Daphnia pulex,NA

It is the most common ectoparasite of marine cage-reared salmonids, causing major economic loss to the aquaculture industry. During a sea louse monitoring programme, samples of L. salmonis were found to harbour an unreported microsporidian parasite. The microsporidian was observed in pre-adult and adult stages of both male and female copepods, with a prevalence of up to 5%. Unfixed spores were slightly pyriform in shape measuring 2.34 μm by 1.83 μm (±0.01 μm) and were not observed to be enclosed by a sporophorous vesicle. The microsporidian infection was observed in all areas of the copepods’ body, xenoma-like cysts forming directly under the cuticle in the epidermal tissue layer. In the present study, rDNA (530f–580r) sequence data gathered from the unidentified microsporidian parasite isolated from infected sea lice were compared with equivalents available in the databases in an attempt to identify its systematic position. The microsporidian was found to group within the phylogenetic clade containing the family Enterocytozoonidae, being most similar to members of the intranuclear genus Nucleospora.

In hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections of infected amphipods, the microsporidian was observed to infect muscle tissue surrounding the ovaries. Melanized hemocytic encapsulations were often observed in or near masses of microsporidians. The microsporidians appeared as spores measuring 1.99 ± 0.09 μm long by 1.19 ± 0.05 μm wide. Each spore contained eight coils of isofilar polar filaments that were arranged in single ranks. Polar filaments measured 71 ± 3 nm in diameter. A prominent lamellar polaroplast composed of ordered concentric membranes was found at the apical end of the spore surrounding the polar filament. A distinct posterior vacuole was observed at the distal end of the spore.

We found three different microsporidia species in this host, all using transovarial (vertical) transmission. All three coexist at different prevalences in two host populations, but bi-infected individuals were rarely found, suggesting no (or very little) horizontal transmission. It is predicted that vertically-transmitted parasites may exhibit sex-specific virulence in their hosts, or they may have either positive or neutral effects on host fitness. All three species differed in their transmission efficiency and infection intensity and our data suggest that these microsporidia exert sex-specific virulence by feminising male hosts. The patterns of infection we found exhibit convergent evolution with those of another amphipod host, Gammarus duebeni. Interestingly, we found that infected females breed earlier in the reproductive season than uninfected females. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to report a positive effect of microsporidian infection on female host reproduction.",Gammarus roeseli; Gammarus balcanicus; Gammarus fossarum,NA,Gammarus balcanicus; Gammarus fossarum,NA

Sp., an Intestinal Microsporidian Associated With Chronic Diarrhea and Dissemination In Aids Patients ::: Intestinal microsporidiosis in patients diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and having chronic diarrhea was first reported in 1985 and the associated microsporidian was named Enterocytozoon bieneusi. the intracellular developmental cycle of E. bieneusi in enterocytes has been demonstrated and many cases have been reported worldwide. This report presents the life cycle of a second intestinal microsporidian, associated with the same symptoms, in five AIDS patients. This new microsporidian also infects enterocytes but its pathology and morphology differ from that of E. bieneusi. It involves lamina propria macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells and can disseminate to infect other parts of the body, e.g. the kidney and gall bladder. the parasite cycle includes development of rounded uninucleate and elongated bi‐ or tetranucleate cells without the formation of plasmodial stages. Sporogony is similar to the more typical development of microsporidia with sporoblast morphogenesis occurring after the last cell division. the development of cells within chambers of a septate, honeycomb‐like, parasite‐secreted fibrillar network and surrounded by a parasitophorous vacuole, however, is unique to this microsporidian, justifying the establishment of a new genus and species, Septata intestinalis n. g., n. sp.",Homo sapiens,NA,Homo sapiens,NA

The parasites (CDC:0291:V213) grew profusely in two of the cultures (HLF and E6) and extruded spores into the culture medium. The spores were Gram-positive, 2.25- to 2.8-microns long, 1.25- to 1.8-microns broad, and smooth-walled. Some of the spores had already extruded their polar tubes, which were either straight or slightly coiled. Infected host cells contained parasitophorous vacuoles filled with developing stages of the parasite, including mature spores. Each spore was surrounded by a thin, electron-dense exospore; a thick electron-lucent endospore; and a thin cell membrane. Cross-sections of six coils of the polar tube were seen inside the spore. Proteins extracted from spores of our isolate and those from Encephalitozoon cuniculi were separated on gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and either silver-stained or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. As many as 35 bands, ranging in molecular mass from 10,000 to 200,000, were visualized in the silver-stained gel. When reacted with the serum of our patient, strips cut from the membrane showed a number of bands ranging in molecular weight from 25,000 to 200,000. However, unique differences between the profiles of the two parasites were seen both in the immunoblot and the silver-stained protein profiles.

All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. The merogonial reproduction was revealed by small groups of merozoites. The dominant sporogony yields four sporoblasts by rosette-like budding, enclosed in a sporophorous vesicle produced by the sporont. Together with the tetrasporous sporogony production of macrospores in 3-, 2- or 1-sporous vesicles occurs. Spores are pyriform, with pointed anterior pole. Fixed tetraspores from A. nervosa measure 3.0-3.5 x 4.6-5.2 mu m. The greatest fixed macrospores observed were 10.4 mu m long. The spore wall has the normal three subdivisions, including a layered, ca 43 nm wide exospore, where the intermediate layer is a double-layer The polaroplast has two lamellar parts, with the anterior lamellae more closely packed. The polar filament is isofilar, with 20-25 coils in tetraspores, up to 34 coils in macrospores. The coils have approximately identical diameter in tetraspores and macrospores. Granular and tubular inclusions of two kinds appear in the episporontal space. Wide, septate tubules of exospore nature disappear when the spores mature. Narrow, thin-walled tubules persist. Macrospores often exhibit aberrant cytology. In A. nervosa the adipose tissue is more or less completely invaded by the parasite. The fat body lobes are not transformed into syncytia. Defense reactions were not observed in this host. Infection in M. lateralis was visible as local herds, and nodule formation with incorporation of dark pigment was observed.

Molecular analyses revealed the two species belong to a clade of microsporidian parasites that preferentially infect the intestinal epithelium of insect and crustacean hosts. These parasites are morphologically distinguishable from other gut microsporidia infecting Artemia. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. Fixed spores measure 1·3×0·7 μm with 5–6 polar tube coils for A. rigaudi and 1·2×0·9 μm with 4 polar tube coils for E. artemiae. Transmission of both species is horizontal, most likely through the ingestion of spores released with the faeces of infected hosts. The minute size of these species, together with their intestinal localization, makes their detection and identification difficult. We developed two species-specific molecular markers allowing each type of infection to be detected within 3–6 days post-inoculation. Using these markers, we show that the prevalence of these microsporidia ranges from 20% to 75% in natural populations. Hence, this study illustrates the usefulness of molecular approaches to study prevalent, but cryptic, infections involving microsporidian parasites of gut tissues.",Artemia franciscana; Artemia monica; parthenogenetica,NA,Artemia monica,NA

This protozoon elicits the formation of large, spore-filled, hypertrophied host cells, cysts. Previous reports of microsporidia in European lophiidsidentifythe parasite as S p r u p u lophii, a genus which has recently been shown to be dimorphic. The spores from L. umericunur are monomorphic (2.8 x 1.5 pm) and uninuclcate. Each spore contains a polar tube that forms six to nine coils. Sprugueu Iophii differs from the microsporidium described in L. umericunus in several ways. Sprugueu lophii has two spore types: a large spore (4.0 x 1.25 pm) containing a diplokaryon and thrcc to four polar tube coils and a smaller uninucleate spore (3.5 x 1.5 pm) with five to six polar tube coils. Because of these major differences,the microsporidium from L. umericunus is removed from the genus Sprugueu and returned to its original genus, Glugeu, as a new species, G. umericunus n. sp. Other ultrastructuralcharacteristicsof G. umericunus are included: the posterior vacuole encloses two distinct membranous structures;one is tubular and resembles a “glomerulartuft“ and the m n d is lamellar and composed of concentric membrane whorls, additionally, the straight or manubroid portion of the polar tube proceeds beyond the posterior vacuole before it turns anteriorly and begins to coil.",Lophius americanus,NA,Lophius americanus,Lophius umericunus

Sp., a Microsporidian Parasite of the Blackfly Odagmia Ornata ::: Hyalinocysta expilatoria n. sp. is described from a larva of Odagmiu oornata collected in Sweden. Infection was restricted to the adipose tissue which was transformed into a syncytium. The earliest stage observed was diplokaryotic merozoites, which mature directly into diplokaryotic sporonts. Each sporont produces a sporophorous vesicle (pansporoblast), which persists, also enclosing mature spores. Usually nuclear divisions result in a plasmodium with 8 nuclei, which fragments into 8 sporoblasts, each of which develops into a spore without further division. Occasionally an aberrant number of spores (2, 4, 6) is formed. The spores are pyriform with a flattened area at the posterior pole. Spores in sporophorous vesicles with 8 spores are 4.0-6.0 μm long, in vesicles with 4 spores 4.0-5.0 μm, and in vesicles with 2 spores 7.0-8.0 μm. In some vesicles the spores develop asynchronously, and 2, 4, or 6 mature spores are found together with 6, 4, or 2 immature. There was also a small number of vesicles with supernumerary spores, less than 8 normally developed. The 325-350 nm thick spore wall is composed of three layers. The polar filament is anisofilar with 7 coils in a single layer. The anterior 5-6 coils are wide, the posterior 2-l thin. The angle of tilt of the anterior filament coil is approximately 50°, The spore has a single nucleus. The sporophorous vesicle is delimited by a thin membrane, also visible in haematoxylin stained preparations. Vesicles with mature spores are void of metabolic inclusions.",Odagmia ornata,NA,Odagmia ornata,Odagmia Ornata

(Microsporida: Amblyosporidae) from the predacious mosquito Culex fuscanus Wiedemann (Diptera: Culicidae) ::: A microsporidium infecting the predacious mosquito Culex fuscanus Wiedemann, collected from Liu-Chiu Islet of Taiwan, was shown to be heterosporous. Two different types of haploid spores, one oval and the other lanceolate, were concurrently produced in the infected larvae. Merogony preceding the sequence leading to oval meiospores ended with the formation of a binucleate sporont with similar ultrastructural features to meronts. Synaptonemal complexes, suggesting that meiosis was involved during this sporogony, appeared in both nuclei of the sporont. The polar filament in the mature meiospore was anisofilar. Nine coiled turns of the polar filament were shown turning about the posterior portion of the spore. The polaroplast was composed of an anterior lamellate part and a posterior vesicular part. The anchoring disc was at the top of the straight portion of the polar filament. The meront of the lanceolate spore cannot be confirmed in this study. Two uninucleate lanceolate spores were eventually formed via nuclear dissociation. The polaroplast of the lanceolate spore was divided into an anterior multi-chambered part and a posterior of reticulate part. The polar filament was of the isofilar type, consisting of at least 5-6 coils. This parasite was extremely similar to the species Amblyospora trinus; in spore shape and development; but different in spore size and their hosts. Although it was similar to species of Amblyospora in host/parasite relations, we would rather assign this parasite to a newly established genus, i.e. Intrapredatorus and the name Intrapredatorus barri n.g., n.sp. was given for this microsporidium.

(Microspora: Glugeidae): A Pathogen of Migratory Locusts (Orthoptera: Acrididae: Oedipodinae) from Madagascar ::: A new microsporidium was isolated from the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria capito, collected in Madagascar. This new species was found to be haplokaryotic throughout development, produced polysporophorous vesicles of parasite origin, and there was conspicuous xenoma formation. The xenoma was a complex structure composed primarily of fat body cells. The wall of the xenoma was bound by a basement membrane beneath which was a region of collagen-like fibers. Multiplication of the parasite occurred by way of both a schizogonic phase and by a sporulation phase. Schizonts divided either directly or with the intervention of paucinucleate plasmodia into additional schizonts. At some point, plasmodia developed (with an increase in size and number of nuclei) into sporogonial plasmodia with typically 16 nuclei. Sporogonial plasmodia elaborated an interfacial envelope within which they underwent sporogony. Sporophorous vesicles normally contained 16 spores but also 8 and rarely 32 spores were formed. Spores were elongate ovoid (sometimes slightly curved) and measured 8.3 by 3.8 μm (fresh) and 6.9 by 4.2 μm (fixed).

Mortalities of varying severity occur at this hatchery every fall, and the microsporidian was noted during an experiment from August 1991 to January 1992 to determine the effects of water source on disease. Infections first appeared to be systemic in the October sample; xenomas were observed in heart, spleen, and peripheral vessel walls. The presence of unidentified intracellular material preceded the appearance of xenomas in all tissues, but whether this material was associated with inflammation or represented immature stages of the parasite has yet to be determined. These structures were also noted in the intestine and liver, although xenomas were not noted in these organs. Mature xenomas did not elicit an inflammatory response but appeared to be short-lived. When the xenoma wall ruptured and released spores, an inflammatory response was again observed. The prevalence and severity of the infection were determined in fish maintained in troughs with well water, Chattahoochee River water, or hatchery (treated river) water. The infection tended to be more prevalent and more severe in fish maintained in the hatchery or river water than in those maintained in the well water.

We provide reference genetic and ultrastructural data for type isolates of C. mellificae (ATCC 30254 and 30862) in comparison with two recent isolates from A. mellifera (BRL and SF). Phylogenetics unambiguously identify strains BRL/SF as a novel taxonomic unit distinct from C. mellificae strains 30254/30862 and assign all four strains as lineages of a novel clade within the subfamily Leishmaniinae. In vivo analyses show strains BRL/SF preferably colonize the hindgut, lining the lumen as adherent spheroids in a manner identical to previous descriptions from C. mellificae. Microscopy images show motile forms of C. mellificae are distinct from strains BRL/SF. We propose the binomial Lotmaria passim n. gen., n. sp. for this previously undescribed taxon. Analyses of new and previously accessioned genetic data show C. mellificae is still extant in bee populations, however, L. passim n. gen., n. sp. is currently the predominant trypanosomatid in A. mellifera globally.

(Microsporidia: Metchnikovellidae), with notes on the ultrastructure of metchnikovellids ::: SUMMARY The present paper reports results of a transmission electron microscopy study of a new metchikovellid microsporidium. It was isolated from gregarines Polyrhabdina sp. inhabiting guts of polychaetes Pygospio elegans sampled at the White Sea silt littoral zone. Free sporogony (FS) occurred in the life cycle of the microsporidium alongside sac-bound sporogony (BS). Free spores resided in a parasitophorous vacuole and were of typical metchnikovellidean structure, uninucleate and oblong. They measured on sections 2·0–3·2×1·3–1·9 μm. The life cycle included pre-sporogonial stages represented by dikaryotic cells and 4-nucleate cells with coupled nuclei. A multinucleate sporogonial plasmodium of FS split in numerous (>10) sporoblasts. In BS segregation of sporoblasts occurred within thick-walled cysts by internal budding. Spore sacs of this microsporidium, measuring on average 11·6×4·7 μm, were limited by a thick electron-dense wall, externally ornamented with spirally wound cords of dense material. These oval spore sacs contained eight barrel-shaped spores, comparable in size and ultrastructure to FS spores. Ultrastructure of both types of spores and intracellular development of the new microsporidium and Metchnikovella spp. were similar, suggesting they belong to the same genus. In this paper we describe a new species Metchnikovella spiralis and discuss morphology of metchnikovellids in the context of putative evolutionary history of Microsporidia.",Polyrhabdina elegans,NA,Polyrhabdina elegans,Polyrhabdina sp.

The final stages of merogony and disporoblastic sporogony with forming of uninucleate sporonts and spores were observed. The rod-shaped stained spores measured 0.7-0.9x2.2-2.4 μm. Uninucleate spores had 9-10 coils of isofilar polar filament and lamellar polaroplast, their thin envelope consisted of plasmalemma, 30-40 nm wide endospore and 18-25 nm wide exposure.",Anoetus feroniarum,NA,Anoetus feroniarum,Anoetus Feroniarum
Microsporidium ceylonensis,"Some ultrastructural data on Microsporidium ceylonensis, a cause of corneal microsporidiosis","Some ultrastructural data on Microsporidium ceylonensis, a cause of corneal microsporidiosis ::: Sections of corneal tissue infected with Microsporidium ceylonensis were restained or processed for electron microscopy. Confirmation was obtained that the parasite develops in macrophages and that spores are uninucleate. New information is provided that sporoblasts and spores develop synchronously within a membrane in the host cell, spores have an anisofilar polar tube of 6-10 wide coils and 2-3 narrow coils and details are given of the spore wall and internal organisation. The parasite was compared on the one hand with Encephalitozoon, which exhibits asynchronous intravacuolar development of merogonic and sporogonic stages and has spores with isofilar polar tubes and on the other hand with species reported from mammals, of which the sporogonic stages develop synchronously within sporophorous vesicles and the spores have anisofilar polar tubes. Even so, a generic emplacement could not be established.

Plurinucleate Plasmodia with nuclei arranged as diplokarya divide, probably by plasmotomy, producing a small number of diplokaryotic merozoites. The number of merogonial cycles is unknown. Each diplokaryotic sporont yields eight monokaryotic sporoblasts in a thin‐walled, more or less fusiform sporophorous vesicle. A small number of multisporoblastic sporophorous vesicles were observed, in which a part of the sporoblasts were anomalous. The sporogony probably begins with a meiotic division. The mature spores are slightly pyriform. Fixed and stained spores measure 2.1‐2.4 × 3.7‐4.5 μm. The five‐layered spore wall is of the Napamichum type. The polar filament is anisofilar with seven to eight coils (142‐156 and 120 nm wide). The angle of tilt is 55‐65°. The polaroplast has an anterior lamellar and a posterior tubular part. The granular, tubular and crystal‐like inclusions of the episporontal space disappear more or less completely when the spores mature. The crystal‐like inclusions are prominent in haematoxylin staining, but not visible with the Giemsa technique.

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has recently become a model host for studying microsporidia through the identification of its natural microsporidian pathogen Nematocida parisii. However, it was unclear how widespread and diverse microsporidia infections are in C. elegans or other related nematodes in the wild. Here we describe the isolation and culture of 47 nematodes with microsporidian infections. N. parisii is found to be the most common microsporidia infecting C. elegans in the wild. In addition, we further describe and name six new species in the Nematocida genus. Our sampling and phylogenetic analysis further identify two subclades that are genetically distinct from Nematocida, and we name them Enteropsectra and Pancytospora. Interestingly, unlike Nematocida, these two genera belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens. All of these microsporidia are horizontally transmitted and most specifically infect intestinal cells, except Pancytospora epiphaga that replicates mostly in the epidermis of its Caenorhabditis host. At the subcellular level in the infected host cell, spores of the novel genus Enteropsectra show a characteristic apical distribution and exit via budding off of the plasma membrane, instead of exiting via exocytosis as spores of Nematocida. Host specificity is broad for some microsporidia, narrow for others: indeed, some microsporidia can infect Oscheius tipulae but not its sister species Oscheius sp. 3, and conversely some microsporidia found infecting Oscheius sp. 3 do not infect O. tipulae. We also show that N. ausubeli fails to strongly induce in C. elegans the transcription of genes that are induced by other Nematocida species, suggesting it has evolved mechanisms to prevent induction of this host response.

Novothelohania ovalae,Ultrastructural characterization and comparative phylogenetic analysis of new microsporidia from Siberian mosquitoes: Evidence for coevolution and host switching,"Ultrastructural characterization and comparative phylogenetic analysis of new microsporidia from Siberian mosquitoes: Evidence for coevolution and host switching ::: Graphical abstract Highlights ► New species of microsporidia are described from Siberian mosquitoes. ► Unique meiospore ultrastructure and SSU rDNA sequences were obtained. ► Phylogenetic trees show a high degree of congruence between parasite and host at the generic level. ► Tree topologies imply cospeciation, host switching and independent parasite speciation. Abstract A survey of mosquito larvae infected with microsporidia was conducted from 2005 to 2008 in the Tomsk, Kemerovo and Novosibirsk regions of western Siberia, Russia. Twenty-one morphologically and genetically unique species of microsporidia were isolated from nine species of Anopheles, Aedes, Culex and Ochlerotatus mosquitoes including: (1) 14 proposed new species of Amblyospora (A. bakcharia, A. baritia, A. bogashovia, A. chulymia, A. hristinia, A. jurginia, A. kazankia, A. mavlukevia, A. mocrushinia, A. modestium, A. salairia, A. severinia, A. shegaria, and A. timirasia); (2) a newly proposed genus and species, Novothelohania ovalae and; (3) six species of Amblyospora (A. flavescens, A. kolarovi, A. rugosa), Parathelohania (P. divulgata and P. tomski) and Trichoctosporea (T. pygopellita) from which gene sequences had not been previously obtained. Detailed ultrastructure of meiospores revealed unique cytological features associated with the length, arrangement and ratio of broad to narrow coils of the polar filament, comparative thickness of the exospore and endospore, and overall size of each species reaffirming their value in distinguishing taxonomic relationships. SSU rDNA sequences obtained from each species of microsporidia were unique when compared with GenBank entries. Phylogenetic trees constructed by Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Neighbor Joining analyses yielded similar topologies with a high degree of congruence between parasite and host at the generic level. Species that parasitize Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Culex mosquitoes segregate into distinct monophyletic groupings mirroring their host phylogeny, while species from Anopheles mosquitoes group as a sister clade basal to the entire group of mosquito-parasitic microsporidia as their Anopheles hosts cluster as a sister clade to the entire group of culicine mosquitoes. This provides strong evidence for host-parasite coevolution by descent at the generic level and limited host lineage switching between unrelated taxa. Among parasites of Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Anopheles mosquitoes, we found several instances where a single mosquito species serves as a host for two or more related species of microsporidia, an observation consistent with host switching and independent parasite speciation. Among the microsporidian parasites of Culex mosquitoes, we found only one parasite per host indicating a higher degree of host specificity and less host switching among parasites of this genus. Findings suggest a degree of host-parasite co-speciation with host switching occurring occasionally when the “normal” host is unavailable in the aquatic ecosystem. Frequency of host switching seems to be occurring in proportion to host relatedness and does not cross generic boundaries in this system.",Ochlerotatus caspius,NA,Ochlerotatus caspius,NA
Nucleophaga terricolae,"Molecular identification of Nucleophaga terricolae sp. nov. (Rozellomycota), and new insights on the origin of the Microsporidia","Molecular identification of Nucleophaga terricolae sp. nov. (Rozellomycota), and new insights on the origin of the Microsporidia ::: Microsporidia are widespread endoparasites of animals, including humans. They are characterized by highly modified morphological and genetic features that cause difficulties in elucidating their enigmatic origin and evolution. Recent advances, however, indicate that the Microsporidia have emerged from the Rozellomycota, forming together either the most basal lineage of the Fungi or its closer relative. The Rozellomycota comprise a huge diversity of uncultured environmental clones, with a very few known species endoparasitic of algae and water moulds, like the chytrid-like Rozella, and of free-living amoebae, like Nucleophaga and the microsporidia-like Paramicrosporidium. A possible ancestral microsporidium, Mitosporidium, has recently been described from the water flea Daphnia, since the phylogenomic reconstruction showed that it branches to the root of the microsporidian tree, while the genome analysis revealed a fungal-like nuclear genome and the persistence of a mitochondrial genome. Here we report the 18S rDNA molecular phylogeny of an additional microsporidium-like endoparasite of amoebae, which has a developmental cycle almost identical to that of Nucleophaga amoebae. Our results show that the endoparasite is closely related to N. amoebae, forming a distinct species, for which we propose the name Nucleophaga terricolae. Furthermore, the Nucleophaga lineage is recovered as sister to the Microsporidia while Mitosporidium turns out to be member of a well-supported group of environmental clones. These results raise the question about the actual ancestry of the Microsporidia within the Rozellomycota. A precise and robust phylogeny will require further comparative genomic studies of these various strains, and should also consider the primitive microsporidia, for which genetic data are still lacking, because all these organisms are essentially morphologically similar.",Thecamoeba terricola,NA,Thecamoeba terricola,NA

In young sporonts, an electron‐lucent space, corresponding to the developing endospore, was immediately observed between both the plasmalemma and the exospore primordium. Sporogonial division occurred also by rosette‐shaped fragmentation, resulting in at least eight sporoblasts that developed directly into spores. Fresh spores were 1.7 × 0.9 μm in size and oval‐shaped. The 8–11 coil isofilar polar filament was arranged in two rows. The polaroplast was bipartite.

(Microsporidia) with a unique dual-host tropism for bluegill sunfish and the digenean parasite Posthodiplostomum minimum (Strigeatida) ::: SUMMARY Microsporidia are diverse opportunistic parasites abundant in aquatic organisms with some species hyperparasitic in digenean parasites. In the current study, we describe a unique microsporidian parasite, Ovipleistophora diplostomuri n. sp. that has a tropism for both the bluegill sunfish Lepomis macrochirus, and its digenean parasite Posthodiplostomum minimum. Though the microsporidium first infects a fish, the subsequent infection causes hypertrophy of the metacercarial wall and degeneration of the P. minimum metacercariae within the fish tissue. Genetic analysis placed this species within Ovipleistophora and ultrastructural characteristics were consistent with the genus, including the presence of dimorphic spores within sporophorous vesicles. Meronts did not have a surface coat of dense material, which has been previously reported for the genus. This is the first Ovipleistophora species described that does not have a tropism for ovary. Genetics demonstrated that O. diplostomuri n. sp. groups closely within fish microsporidia and not other species known to be hyperparasitic in digeneans, suggesting that it evolved from fish-infecting microsporidians and developed a secondary tropism for a common and widespread digenean parasite. The high genetic identity to Ovipleistophora species demonstrates the close relationship of this unique microsporidian with other microsporidia that infect ovary.",Lepomis macrochirus; infected with Posthodiplostomum minimum; Procambarus bivittatus,NA,infected with Posthodiplostomum minimum; Procambarus bivittatus,NA
Pancytospora epiphaga,A Large Collection of Novel Nematode-Infecting Microsporidia and Their Diverse Interactions with Caenorhabditis elegans and Other Related Nematodes,"A Large Collection of Novel Nematode-Infecting Microsporidia and Their Diverse Interactions with Caenorhabditis elegans and Other Related Nematodes ::: Microsporidia are fungi-related intracellular pathogens that may infect virtually all animals, but are poorly understood. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has recently become a model host for studying microsporidia through the identification of its natural microsporidian pathogen Nematocida parisii. However, it was unclear how widespread and diverse microsporidia infections are in C. elegans or other related nematodes in the wild. Here we describe the isolation and culture of 47 nematodes with microsporidian infections. N. parisii is found to be the most common microsporidia infecting C. elegans in the wild. In addition, we further describe and name six new species in the Nematocida genus. Our sampling and phylogenetic analysis further identify two subclades that are genetically distinct from Nematocida, and we name them Enteropsectra and Pancytospora. Interestingly, unlike Nematocida, these two genera belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens. All of these microsporidia are horizontally transmitted and most specifically infect intestinal cells, except Pancytospora epiphaga that replicates mostly in the epidermis of its Caenorhabditis host. At the subcellular level in the infected host cell, spores of the novel genus Enteropsectra show a characteristic apical distribution and exit via budding off of the plasma membrane, instead of exiting via exocytosis as spores of Nematocida. Host specificity is broad for some microsporidia, narrow for others: indeed, some microsporidia can infect Oscheius tipulae but not its sister species Oscheius sp. 3, and conversely some microsporidia found infecting Oscheius sp. 3 do not infect O. tipulae. We also show that N. ausubeli fails to strongly induce in C. elegans the transcription of genes that are induced by other Nematocida species, suggesting it has evolved mechanisms to prevent induction of this host response. Altogether, these newly isolated species illustrate the diversity and ubiquity of microsporidian infections in nematodes, and provide a rich resource to investigate host-parasite coevolution in tractable nematode hosts.",Caenorhabditis brenneri,NA,Caenorhabditis brenneri,NA

Parts of their small subunit, ITS and large subunit ribosomal RNA genes were sequenced and compared with sequences of rDNA obtained from syntype slides of Cougourdella polycentropi Weiser 1965 and Pyrotheca sp. from Hydropsyche pellucidula. All studied caddis fly microsporidia form a closely related group. Their developmental stages in trichopteran hosts are restricted to fat body cells and oenocytes and have isolated nuclei. In late merogony, uninucleate meronts and binucleate plasmodia are formed. In sporogony a sporogonial plasmodium with four nuclei gives rise by rosette-like budding to four sporoblasts within a non-persistent sporophorous vesicle. Sporoblasts mature into pyriform to lageniform spores. The shape and size of spores, the number of polar filament coils, the structure of the polaroplast and of the exospore, together with morphometric characters present a set of markers unique for respective species. Four new species are established. The new genus Paraepiseptum is proposed to replace the tetrasporoblastic Pyrotheca and Cougourdella species from caddis flies. The genus Episeptum is redefined. Field and laboratory examinations as well as the phylogenetic position within the aquatic clade of microsporidia suggest that the life cycle of trichopteran microsporidia probably involves an alternate (copepod?) host and (or) transovarial transmission.",Plectronemia conspersa,NA,Plectronemia conspersa,NA

This report provides a detailed ultrastructural study of the life cycle, including proliferative and sporogonic developmental stages, of the first Pleistophora species (microsporidium) obtained from an immune-incompetent patient. In 1985, the organism obtained from a muscle biopsy was initially identified as belonging to the genus Pleistophora, based on spore morphology and its location in a sporophorous vesicle. Since that initial report, at least two new microsporidial genera, Trachipleistophora and Brachiola, have been reported to infect the muscle tissue of immunologically compromised patients. Because Trachipleistophora development is similar to Pleistophora, and as Pleistophora was only known to occur in cold-blooded hosts, the question of the proper classification of this microsporidium arose. The information acquired in this study makes it possible to compare Pleistophora sp. (Ledford et al. 1985) to the known human infections and properly determine its correct taxonomic position. Our ultrastructural data have revealed the formation of multinucleate sporogonial plasmodia, a developmental characteristic of the genus Pleistophora and not Trachipleistophora. A comparison with other species of the genus supports the establishment of a new species. This parasite is given the name Pleistophora ronneafiei n. sp.",Homo sapiens,NA,Homo sapiens,NA

The parasite is similar to the recently described T. hominis Hollister, Canning, Weidner, Field, Kench and Marriott, 1996, in having isolated nuclei, meronts with a thick layer of electron dense material on the outer face of their plasmalemma and sporogony during which spores are formed inside a thick-walled sporophorous vesicle. In contrast to T. hominis, this species is dimorphic as it forms two kinds of sporophorous vesicles and spores: Type I - round to oval polysporous sporophorous vesicle, 7-10 μm in size, usually with eight spores (3.7 x 2.0 μm), thick endospores, subterminal anchoring disc and anisofilar polar filaments forming seven thicker and two thinner terminal coils. This type of sporophorous vesicle is associated with 25-30 nm filaments extending into the host cell cytoplasm. Type II - smaller, bisporous sporophorous vesicle (4-5 x 2.2-2.5 μm) with two, nearly round, thin-walled spores, 2.2-2.5 x 1.8-2.0 μm in size, having 4-5 isofilar coils. No outside filamentous elements are associated with the bisporous sporophorous vesicle.

Trachipleistophora extenrec,Trachipleistophora extenrec n. sp. a New Microsporidian (Fungi: Microsporidia) Infecting Mammals,"Trachipleistophora extenrec n. sp. a New Microsporidian (Fungi: Microsporidia) Infecting Mammals ::: ABSTRACT. A new microsporidian Trachipleistophora extenrec n. sp. was isolated from a muscle lesion of the streaked tenrec Hemicentetes semispinosus Cuvier, 1798 (Mammalia, Tenrecidae), an insectivore endemic to Madagascar. The spores isolated from the tenrec were infectious to severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice by intramuscular injection. Material obtained from muscular lesions in mice was used for the parasite description. All developmental stages of the microsporidian were covered by a dense coat, which during sporogony changed into the sporophorous vesicle wall. Eight, 16, 32, or more spores were formed inside the sporophorous vesicle as the result of the division by plasmotomy and sequential fission of a multinucleate sporogonial plasmodium. Spores were ovoid, 4.7 × 2.8 μm in size, had a large posterior vacuole, and had an isofilar polar tube with 15–16 coils. Although the fine structure and the developmental pattern of the organism were in some respects similar to the genus Vavraia, molecular phylogeny based on the gene sequences of the small subunit rRNA and RNA polymerase subunit II indicated that the organism belongs to the genus Trachipleistophora. The diagnostic characters of the genera Trachipleistophora and Vavraia are discussed as well as the discrepancies between the phylogenies of these two microsporidian genera based on morphology and molecules.",Hemicentetes semispinosus; Mus musculus,NA,Mus musculus,NA
Trachipleistophora hominis,"Myositis associated with a newly described microsporidian, Trachipleistophora hominis, in a patient with AIDS","Myositis associated with a newly described microsporidian, Trachipleistophora hominis, in a patient with AIDS ::: Microsporidia are zoonotic protozoa which were rare human pathogens prior to 1985, when Enterocytozoon bieneusi was described in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with chronic diarrhea. Another species, Encephalitozoon (Septata) intestinalis, is associated with diarrhea and chronic sinusitis, and approximately 25 cases have been reported in the literature. However, other microsporidial infections in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients remain extremely rare. We report the first case of a Pleistophora sp.-like microsporidian infection presenting as a progressive severe myosotis associated with fever and weight loss. The organism was demonstrated by light microscopy and electron microscopy in corneal scrapings, skeletal muscle, and nasal discharge. Electron microscopy showed an electron-dense surface coat with ''sun-flare''-like projections surrounding all stages of development of meronts (two to four nuclei, dividing by binary fission), sporonts, and sporoblasts. Division of sporonts, in which sporonts separate from the thick outer coat, creating a sporophorous vesicle, is by binary fission, differentiating this organism from Pleistophora sp. The spore measures 4.0 by 2.5 mu m and has a rugose exospore. A new genus and species, Trachipleistophora hominis, has been established for this parasite. The patient was treated with albendazole, sulfadiazine, and pyrimethamine, and the clinical symptoms resolved.",Homo sapiens,NA,Homo sapiens,NA
Trachipleistophora sp.,A Trachipleistophora-like microsporidium of man: Its dimorphic nature and relationship to Thelohania apodemi,"A Trachipleistophora-like microsporidium of man: Its dimorphic nature and relationship to Thelohania apodemi ::: The structure of the human microsporidium found by Yachnis and colleagues in two AIDS patients (Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 106: 535-43, 1996) (hereafter referred to as HMY) was investigated by light and transmission electron microscopy and compared with Thelohania apodemi Doby, Jeannes et Raoult, 1963, a microsporidian of small rodents. The fine structure of the HMY was found to be similar to that of Trachipleistophora hominis Hollister, Canning, Weldner, Field, Kench et Marriott, 1996. Characteristic is the presence of a thick layer of electron dense material on the outer face of the meront plasmalemma, which is maintained during the whole life cycle and which later persists as an electron dense coat on the sporophorous vesicle (SPOV). However, HMY is distinguished from T. hominis during sporogony, as two types of SPOV and spores are formed in HMY. One type of SPOV contains thick-walled spores (usually 8 or more in number) with anisofilar polar filaments of 7 + 2 pattern, while the other type contains only two thin-walled spores with a smaller number (3-5) of isofilar polar filament coils. The HMY differs from T. apodemi which also forms SPOV with 8 spores inside, but the spores of which are larger in size and have 9 + 2 polar filament pattern.",Homo sapiens,NA,Homo sapiens,NA

(Microsporidia: Tuzetiidae) in skeletal muscle of Litopenaeus setiferus and Farfantepenaeus aztecus (Crustacea: Decapoda) and new data on Perezia nelsoni (Microsporidia: Pereziidae) in L. Setiferus ::: A new microsporidian species, Tuzetia weidneri sp. n., is described from the skeletal muscle of the decapod crustaceans Litopenaeus setiferus and Farfantepenaeus aztecus. Fresh spores are pyriform, measuring 3.1 × 2.3 μm. All stages have unpaired nuclei. Meronts lie in direct contact with degenerate host cell cytoplasm but produce numerous small blisters at the surface. Multinucleate meronts divide by constriction into groups or chains of uninucleate products. Sporogony is initiated by deposition of a dense surface coat on the plasma membrane of uninucleate or multinucleate stages and fusion of blisters to enclose the sporont in a sporophorous vesicle (SV). Episporontal secretions in the SV are involved in the division of the sporont. During sporogonic division into chains of sporoblasts, the SV divides together with the body of the sporont, so that each sporoblast is enclosed in its own SV. Spores have a flattened anchoring disc that lies in the polar sac, membranous and spongiform regions of the polaroplast and 9-10.5 coils of the isofilar polar tube, around a posterior vacuole. The endospore layer of the spore wall is not thinned over the anchoring disc. The spore wall is adorned with a complex series of ridges. New data are presented on the spores of Perezia nelsoni (Sprague 1950) in L. setiferus. Of special interest is the polaroplast which is composed of an outer region of tightly-packed membranes in the form of a globule, which almost invariably completely encloses an inner region of loosely packed membranes. The isofilar polar tube, arranged in 8-10 coils angled around the large nucleus in the posterior half of the spore, passes through the membranes of the globular polaroplast near the periphery of the spore, then runs a curved course through the inner polaroplast and passes again through the globular polaroplast to join the anchoring disc.

(Coleoptera: Curculionidae) ::: A newly discovered microsporidium infecting the black vine weevil, Otiorhynchus sulcatus (F.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), provisionally placed in the genus Canningia, was studied to determine its impact on O. sulcatus. O. sulcatus populations from several locations were sampled and evaluated for microsporidiosis. A very low prevalence of the disease was observed in all locations surveyed (<3.0%). Laboratory studies were conducted by orally exposing both larvae and adults of O. sulcatus to varying concentrations of Canningia sp. spores. Larval bioassays at a variety of dosages (0, 10, etc.) were performed to evaluate pathogen infectivity, larval survival and growth. Adult bioassays (dosages: 0, 10, etc.) were performed to evaluate longevity, fecundity and mechanisms of vertical pathogen transmission. Larvae and adults were infected in all spore treatments. Larval growth was significantly reduced at dosages above 10 spores/larva. Adults infected at all dosages experienced high levels of mortality and fecundity was reduced to zero. Greenhouse trials were performed to determine if larvae feeding in soil acquired infections when spores were topically applied as a drench application (0, 10^5, 10^6, 10^7 spores/pot). Established larvae feeding on plant roots in pots developed infections when exposed to drench treatments of 10^6 and 10^7 spores/pot after 14-21 days. Canningia sp. is an acute pathogen of O. sulcatus infective to both larvae and adults. Topically applied spores also infected larvae feeding on roots in soilless potting media, suggesting the possibility of using this pathogen in a microbial control program.",Otiorynchus sulcatus,NA,Otiorynchus sulcatus,NA
Unnamed Microsporidia sp. 3,Microsporidians in penaeid shrimp along the west coast of Madagascar,"Microsporidians in penaeid shrimp along the west coast of Madagascar ::: Three species of penaeid shrimp, Fenneropenaeus indicus, Penaeus monodon and P. sernisulcatus, found in trawler catches off the west coast of Madagascar were infected with microsporidian parasites. The infections were evident as muscular lesions with a cottony appearance when abundant. Spore size (2.6 x 1.6 mum) and morphology (ovoid) for the parasites infecting both F indicus and P. sernisulcatus were not significantly different, suggesting that they might be the same microsporidian species. Spore size (1.4 x 1.1 mum) and morphology (sub-globose to ovoid) in P. monodon infections were significantly different from those in the other 2 shrimp species, suggesting that it was a different parasite. The presence of microsporidians in this biogeographical zone means that there is a potential risk of infections of cultured shrimp in farms situated in the vicinity. This must be assessed by increasing current knowledge of the parasites.",Fenneropenaeus indicus; Penaeus semisulcatus,NA,Penaeus semisulcatus,NA

Unnamed Nosema sp. 506 (1),Pathogens Associated with Southwestern Corn Borers and Southern Corn Stalk Borers (Lepidoptera: Crambidae),"Pathogens Associated with Southwestern Corn Borers and Southern Corn Stalk Borers (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) ::: A study was undertaken to isolate entomopathogens of southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella Dyer, and southern corn stalk borer, Diatraea crambidoides (Grote). Field- collected diapausing larvae of southwestern corn borer (three sites in Mississippi) and southern corn stalk borer (one site in North Carolina), and a laboratory strain of D. grandiosella in the diapause state were maintained in a simulated winter followed by a simulated spring environment. Few larvae (#6%) collected from any of the Þeld sites died in the winter environment, and most insect mortality (11Ð25%) occurred after transfer of the larvae to the simulated spring environment. Mortality during the simulated spring period differed among the collection sites, and the highest mortality was recorded for southwestern corn borers from Washington County (25%), followed by Marshall (16%) and Oktibbeha (11%) Counties. A high level of mortality was also observed in southern corn stalk borers during the simulated spring period (27%). No viruses were observed, but a number of bacteria, microsporidia, and fungi were isolated from both southwestern corn borer and southern corn stalk borer larvae and pupae. In most instances, numerous bacterial taxa were isolated from cadavers, but on some occasions a single taxon predominated. The most prevalent bacterial taxon from larval and pupal cadavers was Enterococcus faecalis (Andrewes & Horder) Schleifer & Kilpper-Balz, but Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Schroeter) Migula, and Serratia marcescens Bizio were frequently isolated as well. Few fungi (1Ð7%) were recovered from southwestern corn borer and southern corn stalk borer larvae and pupae. The most common entomopathogenic taxon isolated was Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin from southern corn stalk borer larvae. Microsporidia were not isolated from southern corn stalk borers. However, Nosema spp. were isolated from southwestern corn borer cadavers from Washington (15%), Marshall (1%), and Oktibbeha (3%) Counties in Mississippi. In addition, we observed parasitism of southern corn stalk borer larvae by Macrocentrus cingulum Reinhard (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). No parasitism of southwestern corn borers was observed. Isolates of Bacillus, Beauveria, Entercoccus, Nosema, Pseudomonas and Serratia were all pathogenic to southwestern corn borer larvae under controlled environmental conditions, and with the exception of B. bassiana, these are novel pathogens of Diatraea corn borers.",Diatraea grandiosella; Ostrinia nubilalis; Diatraea crambidoides,NA,Ostrinia nubilalis,NA

(Microsporidia, Pleistophoridae) in the Brazilian solar salterns ::: A high prevalence of microsporidiosis was detected in an extensive culture of Artemia in two Brazilian solar salterns. The disease was responsible for the disruption of both the eggs and the biomass production. The main microsporidian is primarily a muscular parasite, with pansporoblastic development. All stages presented isolated nuclei. In merogonial stages, the amorphous coat divided with the cell, whereas in the sporogonial plasmodia the protoplasm retracted away from the coat, producing the vesicule cavity. Sporogonial division occurred both stepwise and by rosette-shape fragmentation. The number of nuclei in mature sporonts was variable and sometimes exceeded 64. As the sporophorous vesicle became mature, the matrix was occupied by metabolic granular products that became tubular. Microspores (3.3 × 2.1 μm) and macrospores (4.1 × 2.7 μm) were observed. The number of coils of the anisofilar filament was 11 (microspores) and 15 (macrospores). The ultrastructure and cytology of the parasite revealed that it was a new species: Vavraia anostraca sp. nov. For the first time a species of Vavraia is described in crustaceans.
