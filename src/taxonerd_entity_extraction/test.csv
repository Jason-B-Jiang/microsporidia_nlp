Amblyospora cataphyllus,1992,Microsporidians in bloodsucking Aedes (O.) cataphylla mosquitoes in Ukraine [Mikrosporidii krovososushchikh komarov Aedes (O.) cataphylla Ukrainy.],"The paper reports the results of studies on Microsporidia from the bloodsucking mosquito Aedes cataphylla for the period from 1974 undertaken in the Kiev and Chernigov Provinces of the Ukraine. A new species, Amblyospora cataphyllus sp. n., is described from larvae of the mosquito. Living spores oval or elongate-oval, 6.3--7.5 x 4.5--5.0 (most commonly 6.8 x 4.8) microns, fixed spores oval, 5.6--6.9 x 3.8--4.8 microns. Mucocalyx becomes distinct around spores in 10 to 15 days after the preparation is made. Spontaneously ejected polar tube 125 microns long. Exospore smooth or undulate, 170 to 310 nm thick, endospore 60 to 160 nm. Polaroplast elongated and curved, its 1/3 is composed of closely situated plates and 2/3 of more widely arranged ones. Polar tube anisophyllous, forms 18 to 20 spires in a spore, of which 3 to 5 spires form basal area and 14 to 16 form distal area (of them 1-2 most thick spires form intermediate area). Nucleus large, in a shape of half-ring. In living spores posterior vacuole crescentic, in fixed ones it is strongly deformed together with hind pole of spores. Sporogony of Microsporidia takes place in larvae of mosquitoes of both sexes.

(Microspora, Amblyosporidae) infecting nerve ganglia of Culex pipiens (Diptera, Culicidae) from Egypt","A species of Amblyospora-infecting neurones of Culex pipiens is described. Diplokaryotic meronts, which divided by binary fission, were distinguished at the electron microscope level by their unthickened plasma membranes. Sporonts with an electron-dense surface coat gave rise to eight uninucleate sporoblasts within a sporophorous vesicle, cytoplasmic division occurring at the quadrinucleate or octonucleate stages. Indications that nuclear fusion and chromosome reorganization occurred in merogony and sporogony were obtained by light microscopy but meiosis was not detected at the ultrastructural level. Spores were typical of Amblyospora, being ovoid when fresh, truncate when stained, and having an exospore of two membranous layers subtended by a thick amorphous layer, an electron-lucent endospore, an anisofilar polar filament, and a polaroplast comprised of an anterior region of close-packed lamellae and a posterior region of expanded sacs. The metabolic products in the sporophorous vesicle took the form of large globules, small globules with electron-dense borders, and fine granules. These were depleted in mature sporophorous vesicles, though a surface layer of fine granules on the spores may have been derived from them. Many stages were degenerate and it is suggested that C. pipiens may be an accidental host in which the parasite could develop suboptimally in nervous tissue only. Infections in larvae hatched from eggs in the laboratory indicate that vertical transmission occurs.","9 - 11 (5 - 6 wide, 4 - 5 narrow)",10,FALSE,TRUE

Cucumispora roeselii,2017,"Parasites, Pathogens and Commensals in the ‘Low-Impact’ Non-Native Amphipod Host Gammarus Roeselii","BACKGROUND: Whilst vastly understudied, pathogens of non-native species (NNS) are increasingly recognised as important threats to native wildlife. This study builds upon recent recommendations for improved screening for pathogens in NNS by focusing on populations of Gammarus roeselii in Chojna, north-western Poland. At this location, and in other parts of continental Europe, G. roeselii is considered a well-established and relatively 'low-impact' invader, with little understanding about its underlying pathogen profile and even less on potential spill-over of these pathogens to native species. RESULTS: Using a combination of histological, ultrastructural and phylogenetic approaches, we define a pathogen profile for non-native populations of G. roeselii in Poland. This profile comprised acanthocephalans (Polymorphus minutus Goese, 1782 and Pomphorhynchus sp.), digenean trematodes, commensal rotifers, commensal and parasitic ciliated protists, gregarines, microsporidia, a putative rickettsia-like organism, filamentous bacteria and two viral pathogens, the majority of which are previously unknown to science. To demonstrate potential for such pathogenic risks to be characterised from a taxonomic perspective, one of the pathogens, a novel microsporidian, is described based upon its pathology, developmental cycle and SSU rRNA gene phylogeny. The novel microsporidian Cucumispora roeselii n. sp. displayed closest morphological and phylogenetic similarity to two previously described taxa, Cucumispora dikerogammari (Ovcharenko & Kurandina, 1987), and Cucumispora ornata Bojko, Dunn, Stebbing, Ross, Kerr & Stentiford, 2015. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to our discovery extending the host range for the genus Cucumispora Ovcharenko, Bacela, Wilkinson, Ironside, Rigaud & Wattier, 2010 outside of the amphipod host genus Dikerogammarus Stebbing, we reveal significant potential for the co-transfer of (previously unknown) pathogens alongside this host when invading novel locations. This study highlights the importance of pre-invasion screening of low-impact NNS and, provides a means to document and potentially mitigate the additional risks posed by previously unknown pathogens.",2022-09-10,9.5,FALSE,TRUE
Enterospora canceri,2007,"Enterospora canceri n. gen., n. sp., intranuclear within the hepatopancreatocytes of the European edible crab Cancer pagurus","Only 1 genus (Nucleospora) within 1 family (Enterocytozoonidae) of the Microsporidia contains species that are parasitic within the nuclei of their host cells; to date, all described intranuclear Nucleospora spp. parasitise fish. This study describes the first intranuclear microsporidian parasite of an invertebrate, the European edible crab Cancer pagurus L. (Decapoda: Cancridae). Infected crabs displayed no obvious external signs, and maximum apparent prevalence of infection within a monthly sample was 3.45 %. Infected hepatopancreatic tubules were characterised by varying numbers of hypertrophic and eosinophilic nuclei within epithelial cells. Parasite stages appeared as eosinophilic granular accumulations causing margination of host chromatin. In advanced cases, the tubule epithelia degenerated, with parasites and sloughed epithelial cells appearing in tubule lumens. All life stages of the parasite were observed within host nuclei. Uninucleate meronts were not detected, although binucleate stages were observed. Multinucleate Plasmodia (sporogonal Plasmodia) contained up to 22 nuclei in section, and late-stage Plasmodia contained multiple copies of apparatus resembling the polar filament and anchoring disk, apparently associated with individual plasmodial nuclei. As such, aggregation and early assembly of sporoblast components took place within the intact sporogonial Plasmodium, a feature unique to the Enterocytozoonidae. Liberation of sporoblasts from Plasmodia or the presence of liberated sporoblasts was not observed in this study. However, large numbers of maturing and mature spores (measuring 1.3 ± 0.02 x 0.7 ± 0.01 μm) were frequently observed in direct contact with the host nucleoplasm. Considering the shared features of this parasite with microsporidians of the family Enterocytozoonidae, and the unique presence of this parasite within the nucleoplasm of decapod crustacean hepatopancreatocytes, this parasite (Enterospora canceri) is proposed as the type species of a new genus (Enterospora) of microsporidian.

The needle‐shaped spores were rounded anteriorly, tapered to a posterior point and measured 7.1–11.8 × 0.2–0.3 μm in fixed preparations. The extremely narrow spore diameter prevented observation of morphological details at the light microscopic level and ultrastructural details of mature spores were difficult to resolve. Meronts were not observed and the monokaryotic merozoites and sporonts were not contained within either parasitophorous or sporophorous vesicles. Sporonts were disporoblastic and gave rise to monokaryotic sporoblasts that became narrow and elongate as they developed into immature spores with a developing polar filament. The nucleus was not clearly resolved in mature spores and may have been surrounded by the lamellar polaroplast. The polar filament was of nearly uniform diameter throughout most of its length and ended abruptly about three‐fourths of the distance from the anterior end of the spore. Unusual spherical non‐membrane bound granules surrounded the polar filament in a spiral arrangement. The new microsporidium resembles members of the family Mrazekiidiae, but differs in lacking a diplokaryon at any stage.

Nosema epilachnae,1985,"Two New Species of Nosema (Microsporida: Nosematidae) from the Mexican Bean Beetle Epilachna Varivestis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) 1 , 2","Two new species of the genus Nosema (Microsporida: Nosematidae) are described from the Mexican bean beetle, Epilachna varivestis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and their life cycle stages studied by light and electron microscopy. Both species are monomorphic and disporous; they develop in direct contact with the cytoplasm of host cells and the nuclei of all stages are diplokaryotic. The more virulent species produces systemic infections most extensively in the adipose tissue, muscles, and Malpighian tubules of larvae and also invades the reproductive tissues of adult beetles. During merogonic development, it forms chains of diplokaryotic meronts. The fine structure of the sporoblast nuclei shows clumped material in the pole of each nucleus opposite their common plane of apposition. Spores are straight to slightly curved and ovocylindrical in shape and they measure 5.3 ± 0.13 x 2.1 ± 0.03 μm. The less virulent species also invades most host tissues but does not develop in the midgut epithelium; the Malpighian tubules are the principal site of its development and it also invades the ovaries and testes of adult beetles. Merogony occurs exclusively as the result of binary fission of diplokaryotic meronts. The plasmalemma of the meronts is covered with a thin deposit of exospore material upon which are located closely packed tubules that encircle the body transversely. A thickened deposit of exospore material on the surface of the diplokaryotic sporonts later obscures these tubules. Other tubules occur free in the host cell cytoplasm or attached to the plasmalemma of meronts and sporonts. Secretory granules also occur free or in chains in the host cytoplasm and are probably produced from the surface of the sporoblasts. Sporoblasts also contain an unusual cup-shaped organelle associated with a dense body, which is apparently involved in the formation of the polar tube and its associated organelles in the anterior part of the spore.

Infected larvae were processed for transmission electronic microscopy using conventional methods at pH 7.2 and 260 mOsm/l. The infection by the microsporidia was positively correlated with an increase in the mean duration of the fourth instar of 2.88 to 6.33 days in 10 g/l of salt and of 2.47 to 6.14 days in 20 g/l of salt. Larval mortality also increased by approximately 50% during this instar in both salt concentrations. Development time and survival were not affected during the other immature stages.

We have re-investigated the material upon which the original description of N. maroccanus was based and revealed new ultrastructural characters of its cell surface. Late meronts are surrounded with microtubuli, about 20 nm in diameter, attached to the membrane, later replaced with electron dense granules, forming a typical coating of the sporont's surface (the primordium of exospore). Mature spores are also surrounded with a layer of microtubuli. Host cell cytoplasm contains small vesicles with electron-dense cores, up to 50 nm in diameter, surrounding late meronts, sporogonial stages and spores of the parasite. Polar tube is slightly anisofilar. These characters disagree with the diagnosis of Nosema, but fit that of the recently established genus Tubulinosema. Hence, we transferred the species studied into this genus, establishing Tubulinosema maroccanus comb. nov. Analysis of cell surface ultrastructure of two Tubulinosema species from Orthoptera showed that they shared two characters not mentioned in the diagnosis of the genus.

The diplokaryotic life-cycle, absence of spore groupings and of a pansporoblast membrane typify the genus Nosema. However, the unusual globular polaroplast of the spore and restriction of this stage to host ovarian tissue, have not previously been described in Nosema. Sporogony occurred only in follicle cells adjacent to developing oocytes and was in synchrony with the process of vitellogenesis. Oocytes were infected after formation of intracellular connections with follicle cells but harboured only vegetative stages of the parasite. Parasites were associated with the perinuclear cytoplasm and, in developing embryos, segregated to daughter cells along the axis of the spindle. In juvenile animals there was no evidence of pathology linked with feminization and the parasite was found at low density in cells under the cuticle. The parasite is highly adapted to transovarial transmission with an efficient mechanism of oocyte infection and no evidence of pathology.",NA,3,FALSE,TRUE
unnamed microsporidium in gastrotrich,1999,"First finding of a microsporidian parasite in the gastrotrich, Turbanella lutheri (Gastrotricha: Macrodasyida)","A microsporidian parasite is reported for the first time in Turbanella lutheri (Gastrotricha: Macrodasyida), a representative of a new host class. Sporonts, sporoblasts, and spores located in host-derived vacuoles within the intestine cells are documented by TEM micrographs. Mature spores, shells of hatched spores, and everted polar tubes occur also in the gut lumen of the host.",4 - 5,4.5,FALSE,TRUE
Vavraia sp.,1990,Fine structure and sporogonic development of a Vavraia sp. (Microsporida: Pleistophoridae) in the biting midge Culicoides edeni (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae),"A microsporidium with ultrastructural characteristics of the genus Vavraia was found in the fat body of an adult specimen of Culicoides edeni (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) collected in northern Florida. The sporogonial stages developed within sporophorous vesicles, which contained variable numbers of oval spores at maturity. The wall of the sporophorous vesicle was composed of two electron-dense outer layers and an electron-lucent intermediate layer. Sporonts contained haplokaryotic nuclei and divided by rosette formation. Mature spores had anisofilar polar filaments and measured 3.8 ± 0.28 μm in length and 2.2 ± 0.16 μm in width in thick sections of resinembedded material. This is the first report of a Vavraia sp. from a species of Culicoides.",NA,"11 (5 or 6 anterior coils, 5 or 6 posterior coils)",FALSE,TRUE
