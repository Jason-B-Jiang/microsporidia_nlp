Amblyospora cataphyllus,"Microsporidians in bloodsucking Aedes (O.) cataphylla mosquitoes in Ukraine [Mikrosporidii krovososushchikh komarov Aedes (O.) cataphylla Ukrainy.] ::: The paper reports the results of studies on Microsporidia from the bloodsucking mosquito Aedes cataphylla for the period from 1974 undertaken in the Kiev and Chernigov Provinces of the Ukraine. A new species, Amblyospora cataphyllus sp. n., is described from larvae of the mosquito. Living spores oval or elongate-oval, 6.3--7.5 x 4.5--5.0 (most commonly 6.8 x 4.8) microns, fixed spores oval, 5.6--6.9 x 3.8--4.8 microns. Mucocalyx becomes distinct around spores in 10 to 15 days after the preparation is made. Spontaneously ejected polar tube 125 microns long. Exospore smooth or undulate, 170 to 310 nm thick, endospore 60 to 160 nm. Polaroplast elongated and curved, its 1/3 is composed of closely situated plates and 2/3 of more widely arranged ones. Polar tube anisophyllous, forms 18 to 20 spires in a spore, of which 3 to 5 spires form basal area and 14 to 16 form distal area (of them 1-2 most thick spires form intermediate area). Nucleus large, in a shape of half-ring. In living spores posterior vacuole crescentic, in fixed ones it is strongly deformed together with hind pole of spores. Sporogony of Microsporidia takes place in larvae of mosquitoes of both sexes. Infection extensiveness of IV stage larvae is 10%.",NA,NA,NA,125
Ameson atlanticum,"Ultrastructural Observations of the Life Cycle Stages of Ameson Atlanticum Sp. Nov., a Microsporidan Parasitizing Cancer Pagurus L. ::: Cancer pagurus (Cancridae) from the Atlantic coast of France is parasitized by a new species of microsporida Ameson atlantieuin sp. nov. The main stages of the life eyele of the parasite are a monokaryotic and then diplokaryotic meront. tetranucleate (at least) sporont (sporogonial sporont), uninucieate sporoblast and spore. The spore (1-9x1 5 ixm) possesses 11-12 coils of the polar filament and a lamellar polaroplast. Hairlike appendages are present on the surface of the sporoblastic plasmodium, sporoblast and spore. All stages take place in direct contact with the muscular tissue of the crab. Infection provokes the destruetion of 80% of host musele myofibrils.",NA,NA,NA,52
Ciliatosporidium platyophryae,"Ciliatosporidium platyophryae nov. gen., nov. spec. (Microspora incerta sedis), a parasite of Platyophrya terricola (Ciliophora, Colpodea) ::: Ciliatosporidium platyophryae nov. gen., nov. spec, is a microsporidian parasite affecting the soil ciliate Cirrophrya terricola Foissner, 1987. It was found in a soil sample from Utah (USA), pure cultures were not available. The developmental stages seen are uninucleate and divide by binary fission (disporoblastic). Each sporont is enveloped by a membranelike exospore precursor and a parasitophorous vacuole deriving from host endoplasmic reticulum and persisting during spore maturation. The spore is rod-shaped with hemispherical ends and measures about 4×2 μm. It has a short, uncoiled polar filament and conspicuous, possibly transient sacs in the wide anterior lamellae of the bipartite polaroplast. The exospore has the appearance of a unit membrane. Maturing spores induce the formation of appendages (“feet”) at the posterior end of the host which was thus formerly assigned to the genus Cirrophrya. However, our study shows that the feet are a pathological phenomenon and the host thus belongs to the genus Platyophrya: Platyophrya terricola (Foissner, 1987) nov. comb. Despite its unusual host, the fine structure of C. platyophryae is very similar to that of microsporidia from other invertebrate and vertebrate hosts. Very likely, C. platyophryae is related to the genera Oligosporidium, Encephalitozoon, Unikaryon and Endoreticulatus, presently assigned to the families Encephalitozoonidae and/or Unikaryonidae. However, for a definite classification of C. platyophryae more detailed data on its life cycle and membranous envelopes are necessary. Thus, we prefer an incerta sedis position.",NA,NA,NA,2.5 (5/8 of spore length)
Encephalitozoon sp. 3,"Ultrastructure of the development of a species of Encephalitozoon cultured from the eye of an AIDS patient ::: Human fibroblast cell cultures inoculated with microsporidia-infected corneal scrapings from an AIDS patient were fixed in situ and examined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The parasite grew prolifically and all developmental stages were observed. Meronts underwent binary fission and the daughter cells transformed into clongate, chain-like sporonts that eventually separated into sporoblasts. The formation of components of the mature spores is described. The parasite, a species of Encephalitozoon, underwent development both in the cytoplasm and within a parasitophorous vacuole, distinguishing it from the morphologically similar species E. cuniculi and E. hellem, both of which have been described from lesions in the human eye and have been reported to develop exclusively within a parasitophorous vacuole.",NA,NA,NA,19.26 ± 3.35
Euplotespora binucleata,"Euplotespora binucleata n. gen., n. sp. (Protozoa: Microsporidia), a Parasite Infecting the Hypotrichous Ciliate Euplotes woodruffi, with Observations on Microsporidian Infections in Ciliophora ::: ABSTRACT. A new microsporidian species, Euplotespora binucleata n. gen., n. sp., from the brackish-water ciliate Euplotes woodruffi is described and defined on the basis of life history characteristics, light and electron microscopic features, and small subunit (SSU) ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing. The life cycle of E. binucleata n. sp. probably has rather short merogonic and relatively long sporogonic phases. Some uninuclear meronts and sporonts, along with diplokaryotic sporoblasts and spores, were found in experimentally infected host cells. Such a peculiar life cycle has been induced experimentally in Euplotes eurystomus and constitutively microsporidian-free stocks of E. woodruffi. Spores of E. binucleata n. sp. are monomorphic, ovoid–cylindrical in shape, 3.44±0.17 × 1.65±0.22 μm in size, and characterized by a diplokaryotic condition and a large posterior vacuole. The polar tube is isofilar, 4.5–5.5 μm in length when ejected, and lacking a distinctive coiled region (half-coiled). The polaroplast is divided into two regions: the anterior part has a few lamellae close to the anchoring disc; and the posterior part is a rounded body (sack), about one-quarter of the spore length. Spores do not appear to cluster together as a group. Each spore is surrounded by a sporophorous membrane closely adjacent to the exospore layer. A phylogenetic analysis of SSU rDNA sequences by different methods placed E. binucleata n. sp. in a clade with representatives of the microsporidian genera Cystosporogenes and Vittaforma. Observations of microsporidia in several other ciliates are discussed in view of the microsporidian infection frequency in the phylum Ciliophora.",NA,5.5,4.5,5
Glugea malabaricii,"A New Microsporidian Glugea Malabaricii Sp. n. from the Viscera of Carangoides Malabaricus Bl ::: A new microsporidian parasite of a freshwater fish Mesocottus haitej from the Amur River basin of Russia is described using light microscopy. The numerous whitish xenomas, round or oval, up to 3.0 mm large were found to be located in subcutaneous tissue of the body and mouth cavity, in the intestine and other internal organs. The formol fixed spores are elongate oval, measuring 4.8 (4.5-5.0) x 2.3 (2.2-2.5) microm in a wet smears. Posterior vacuole occupies about half of the spores.

Glugea plecoglossi,"Studies on Glugea Infection of the Ayu, Plecoglossus altivelis—I ::: A new species of microsporidian parasite of the ayu, Plecoglossus altivelis T. & S., is described and the name Glugea plecoglossi T. sp. is suggested. In a heavy infection of the parasite xenomas develop in large number in various organs, viz., peritoneum, visceral cavity, ovaries, testis, fat body, pyloric caeca, spleen, muscle, liver, heart, gills, iris, etc., and cause serious damage to fish. The xenomas are variable in size, being 0.5-3 mm, rarely as large as 5 mm. Fresh spores of the parasite are elongate or ellipsoidal and are 5.1-6.2 x 2.0-2.5µ, the average of 200 spores being 5.8 x 2.1 Spores fixed in Bouin's solution and stained with Heidenhein's iron hematoxylin are 3.S-4.8 x 1.5-2.0 µ the average of 50 spores being 4.0 X 1.8 µ. Everted filaments are 180 µ at maximum, being 100-150 µ in the majority. The processes of schizogony and sporogony of the parasite studied with artificially infected ayu are in substance the same as those reported by Weissenberg (1968) on Glugea anomala and by Sprague and Yernick (1968) on G. weissenbergu A very small xenoma of 4x8 µ with a single schizont and a single host cell nucleus was found in the lamina propria of the villi of the gut of an ayu killed 5 days after infection. Sporonts in smear preparations of parasite are 3 x 4 µ and each sporont produce two spores. Therefore the parasite is classified into the genus Glugea. Inoculation experiments have shown that Salmo gairdneri is susceptible to the parasite, but. Gasterosteus acelatus microcephalus is unsusceptible. Of about 15 species of Glugea in fish, G. hertwigi has spores similar in size to those of the present Glugea, But the former differs from the latter in the following points. The hosts of G. hertwigi are Osmerus mordax and O. eperlanus and it has been reported by Weissenberg (1968) that Gasterosteus aceleatus is susceptible to G. hertwigi, G. anomala and G. weissenhergi are distinguishable in having smaller spores, 3 x 1.5-2 µ, and larger spores, 6.0-7.0 X 2.5-3.6 µ, respectively, and in having different hosts, the sticklebacks. G, takedai which was found in the rainbow trout in Japan is distinguishable in having smaller spores, 2.8-4.9 x 1.7-2.3 µ, and in not causing hypertrophy of the infected host cells.",NA,180,100,125 (midpoint of 100 - 150)
Helmichia glandulicola,"Helmichia glandulicola sp.nov. (Microspora, Thelohaniidae): morphology, development and influence on salivary glands of Chironomus anthracinus (Diptera, Chironomidae) ::: Helmichia glandulicola, a microsporidian parasite specific for cells of the salivary glands of the midge Chironomus anthracinus, is described. It is characterized by tubular spores with a distinct polar cap that are enclosed in persistent octosporous pansporoblasts. The pansporoblastic membrane is formed early during the first sporogonial division. A granular secretion occurs in the pansporoblast among the oval sporoblasts, which subsequently become tubular and display a rigid polar filament. The solitary infected cell reacts with hypertrophy and depletion of its endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomal system. There are differences in the morphology of mitochondria in infected vs noninfected cells. The production of saliva by the host is only partially reduced following infection. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",NA,2.8,3,2.9
Intexta acarivora,"Intexta acarivora gen. et sp. n. (Microspora: Chytridiopsidae)-ultrastructural study and description of a new microsporidian parasite of the forage mite Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Acari: Acaridae) ::: The microsporidium Intexta acarivora gen. et sp. n., a parasite of the gut epithelium of the forage mite Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Schrank, 1781) is described based on ultrastructural characteristics. Reproduction is restricted to the production of sporoblasts. The sporont has isolated nuclei, and the external pan of the sporont (plasma membrane and peripheral zone of cytoplasm) remains as an envelope collecting the uninucleate sporoblasts. Sporogony is by vacuolation, and mature spores are spherical to slightly ovoid and lack a polaroplast. Microspores (1.3-1.7 μm wide) are dominant, and only a small percentage of macrospores (1.5-2.3 μm wide) were seen. The exospore is composed as a thin (ca 16 nm) uniform, electron-dense layer; the endospore is well developed. The polar filament is completely coiled and anisofilar, and in microspores arranged in 2-3 coils (anterior 1-2 wider); macrospores have up to 9 coils (anterior 3-4 wider). The external zone of the polar filament contains tubular material, and the polar sac is without an anchoring disc.

Janacekia adipophila,"The Light and Electron Microscopic Cytology of Janacekia adipophila N. Sp. (Microspora, Tuzetiidae), a Microsporidian Parasite of Ptychoptera paludosa (Diptera, Ptychopteridae) ::: The microsporidium Janacekia adipophila n. sp., a parasite of Ptychoptera paludosa larvae in Sweden, is described based on light microscopic and ultrastructural characteristics. Merogonial stages and sporonts are diplokaryotic. Merozoites are formed by rosette‐like division. Sporonts develop into sporogonial plasmodia with isolated nuclei. These plasmodia give rise to 8–16 sporoblasts by rosette‐like budding. A sporophorous vesicle is initiated by the sporogonial plasmodium. Sporoblasts and spores are enclosed in individual sporophorous vesicles. Granular inclusions of the vesicles, visible using light microscopy, discriminate sporogonial stages from stages of the merogony. The monokaryotic, fresh spores are oval with blunt ends, measuring 4.2‐6.3 × 9.1‐11.2 μm. Macrospores are formed in small numbers. The spore wall has three subdivisions and the exospore is electron‐dense. The polaroplast has two parts: closely arranged lamellae anteriorly, wider sac‐like compartments posteriorly. The isofilar polar filament, 191–264 nm wide, has 12‐13 coils, which are arranged in one layer in the posterior half of the spore. The electron‐dense inclusions of the sporophorous vesicle are modified during sporogony, and vesicles with mature spores are traversed by 21–27 nm wide tubules, which connect the exospore with the envelope of the vesicle. The walls of the tubules, the envelope of the vesicles, and the surface layer of the exospore are all identical double‐layered structures. The microsporidium is compared to microsporidia of Ptychopteridae and Tipulidae and to related microsporidia of the family Tuzetiidae.",NA,235 (max),NA,NA
Microfilum lutjani,"Microfilum Lutjani N. G. N. Sp.

(Microsporida) was found on the gill filaments of Lutjanus fulgens (Teleost) inhabiting the coasts of Senegal. This microsporidium forms xenomas distinguished by the microvilli covering the plasma membrane. At all stages of development individuals have isolated nuclei and are in direct contact with the host cytoplasm. Merogony is binary and sporogony is tetrasporoblastic. the spore (4.75 times 2.60 μm)) is characterized by a manubrium inserted on a laterally offset anchoring disc and extending into a very short, noncoiled polar filament (no longer than 500 nm) in the form of a hook.

Microgemma hepaticus,"Hepatic microsporidiosis of juvenile grey mullet, Chelon labrosus (Risso), due to Microgemma hepaticus gen.nov. sp.nov. ::: Microgemma hepaticus gen.nov. sp.nov. is described from the liver of juvenile grey mullet, Chelon labrosus (Risso). Development occurs within xenomas (diameter 500μm) which have microvillar surfaces, encircling bands of mitochondria and a reticulate hypertrophic nucleus. Vegetative developmental stages, meronts, are plasmodial and divided by plasmotomy. These stages are enclosed by host membranes. Sporogonic stages are free in the cytoplasm and divide by multiple exogenous budding. Uninucleate spores (2·4μm × 4·2μm) possess 7–9 coils of the polar filament and a lamellar polaroplast. Xenomas are associated with liver connective tissue, and cause necrosis of adjacent liver cells in certain circumstances. Host response to infection involves leucocyte infiltration and granuloma formation, with spores being destroyed by repeated macrophage phagocytosis and necrosis and resulting in gradual resolution of the lesion. Although juveniles apparently tolerate large parasite burdens there is some evidence of a contribution by the parasite to stress‐related mortality. The transmission of the disease and its potentially high pathogenicity to larval fishes is discussed.",NA,NA,NA,57

Meronts are spherical at first, then become irregular as nuclear number increases. Sporonts are tubular or ribbon-like and divide unevenly to produce sporoblasts and then spores of varying lengths. Sporogonial stages are enclosed in a vesicle by a subpersistent membrane of uncertain origin. Fresh spores measure 3.5 by 2.08 Fm and are produced in clusters of 12 to 120.

Nadelspora canceri,"Nadelspora canceri N. G., N. Sp., an Unusual Microsporidian Parasite of the Dungeness Crab, Cancer Magister ::: The microsporidium Nadelspora canceri n. g., n. sp., is described from the striated musculature of the Dungeness crab (Cancer magister) in Oregon, USA. The needle‐shaped spores were rounded anteriorly, tapered to a posterior point and measured 7.1–11.8 × 0.2–0.3 μm in fixed preparations. The extremely narrow spore diameter prevented observation of morphological details at the light microscopic level and ultrastructural details of mature spores were difficult to resolve. Meronts were not observed and the monokaryotic merozoites and sporonts were not contained within either parasitophorous or sporophorous vesicles. Sporonts were disporoblastic and gave rise to monokaryotic sporoblasts that became narrow and elongate as they developed into immature spores with a developing polar filament. The nucleus was not clearly resolved in mature spores and may have been surrounded by the lamellar polaroplast. The polar filament was of nearly uniform diameter throughout most of its length and ended abruptly about three‐fourths of the distance from the anterior end of the spore. Unusual spherical non‐membrane bound granules surrounded the polar filament in a spiral arrangement. The new microsporidium resembles members of the family Mrazekiidiae, but differs in lacking a diplokaryon at any stage. It is probably most closely related to Baculea daphniae from which it differs primarily by spore shape and size. The familial relationships of the genus Baculea have not been determined and it is proposed to include it with Nadelspora in the new family Nadelsporidae.",NA,NA,NA,7.5
Nematocida displodere,"Discovery of a Natural Microsporidian Pathogen with a Broad Tissue Tropism in Caenorhabditis elegans ::: Microbial pathogens often establish infection within particular niches of their host for replication. Determining how infection occurs preferentially in specific host tissues is a key aspect of understanding host-microbe interactions. Here, we describe the discovery of a natural microsporidian parasite of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that displays a unique tissue tropism compared to previously described parasites of this host. We characterize the life cycle of this new species, Nematocida displodere, including pathogen entry, intracellular replication, and exit. N. displodere can invade multiple host tissues, including the epidermis, muscle, neurons, and intestine of C. elegans. Despite robust invasion of the intestine very little replication occurs there, with the majority of replication occurring in the muscle and epidermis. This feature distinguishes N. displodere from two closely related microsporidian pathogens, N. parisii and N. sp. 1, which exclusively invade and replicate in the intestine. Comparison of the N. displodere genome with N. parisii and N. sp. 1 reveals that N. displodere is the earliest diverging species of the Nematocida genus. Over 10% of the proteins encoded by the N. displodere genome belong to a single species-specific family of RING-domain containing proteins of unknown function that may be mediating interactions with the host. Altogether, this system provides a powerful whole-animal model to investigate factors responsible for pathogen growth in different tissue niches.",NA,NA,NA,12.55 µm +/- 3.20 µm (fixed)

Nosema epilachnae,"Two New Species of Nosema (Microsporida: Nosematidae) from the Mexican Bean Beetle Epilachna Varivestis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) 1 , 2 ::: Two new species of the genus Nosema (Microsporida: Nosematidae) are described from the Mexican bean beetle, Epilachna varivestis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and their life cycle stages studied by light and electron microscopy. Both species are monomorphic and disporous; they develop in direct contact with the cytoplasm of host cells and the nuclei of all stages are diplokaryotic. The more virulent species produces systemic infections most extensively in the adipose tissue, muscles, and Malpighian tubules of larvae and also invades the reproductive tissues of adult beetles. During merogonic development, it forms chains of diplokaryotic meronts. The fine structure of the sporoblast nuclei shows clumped material in the pole of each nucleus opposite their common plane of apposition. Spores are straight to slightly curved and ovocylindrical in shape and they measure 5.3 ± 0.13 x 2.1 ± 0.03 μm. The less virulent species also invades most host tissues but does not develop in the midgut epithelium; the Malpighian tubules are the principal site of its development and it also invades the ovaries and testes of adult beetles. Merogony occurs exclusively as the result of binary fission of diplokaryotic meronts. The plasmalemma of the meronts is covered with a thin deposit of exospore material upon which are located closely packed tubules that encircle the body transversely. A thickened deposit of exospore material on the surface of the diplokaryotic sporonts later obscures these tubules. Other tubules occur free in the host cell cytoplasm or attached to the plasmalemma of meronts and sporonts. Secretory granules also occur free or in chains in the host cytoplasm and are probably produced from the surface of the sporoblasts. Sporoblasts also contain an unusual cup-shaped organelle associated with a dense body, which is apparently involved in the formation of the polar tube and its associated organelles in the anterior part of the spore.

Mono- and binuclear schizonts are formed during first and 2nd schizogony; these are usually rounded and measure 0.9 to 2.1 and 1.6 to 4.8 mu m, respectively. The round sporonts (1.1 to 2.1 mu m) have an elongated nucleus and give rise to elongated sporoblasts dividing usually into 2 spores. Occasionally, a sporoblast fails to divide and becomes a macrospore. The polar filament is 15 to 32 mu m long. N. telengae is differentiated from all species of Nosema parasitic in Tortricidae by the shape and size of the spores, the ability to form macrospores and the length of the polar filament. N. telengae parasitizes all the tissues of its host with the exception of the hypodermis and nervous tissue.

Nosema varivestis,"Two New Species of Nosema (Microsporida: Nosematidae) from the Mexican Bean Beetle Epilachna Varivestis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) 1 , 2 ::: Two new species of the genus Nosema (Microsporida: Nosematidae) are described from the Mexican bean beetle, Epilachna varivestis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and their life cycle stages studied by light and electron microscopy. Both species are monomorphic and disporous; they develop in direct contact with the cytoplasm of host cells and the nuclei of all stages are diplokaryotic. The more virulent species produces systemic infections most extensively in the adipose tissue, muscles, and Malpighian tubules of larvae and also invades the reproductive tissues of adult beetles. During merogonic development, it forms chains of diplokaryotic meronts. The fine structure of the sporoblast nuclei shows clumped material in the pole of each nucleus opposite their common plane of apposition. Spores are straight to slightly curved and ovocylindrical in shape and they measure 5.3 ± 0.13 x 2.1 ± 0.03 μm. The less virulent species also invades most host tissues but does not develop in the midgut epithelium; the Malpighian tubules are the principal site of its development and it also invades the ovaries and testes of adult beetles. Merogony occurs exclusively as the result of binary fission of diplokaryotic meronts. The plasmalemma of the meronts is covered with a thin deposit of exospore material upon which are located closely packed tubules that encircle the body transversely. A thickened deposit of exospore material on the surface of the diplokaryotic sporonts later obscures these tubules. Other tubules occur free in the host cell cytoplasm or attached to the plasmalemma of meronts and sporonts. Secretory granules also occur free or in chains in the host cytoplasm and are probably produced from the surface of the sporoblasts. Sporoblasts also contain an unusual cup-shaped organelle associated with a dense body, which is apparently involved in the formation of the polar tube and its associated organelles in the anterior part of the spore. Spores are ellipsoidal to slightly pyriform and measure 4.7 ± 0.06 x 2.6 ± 0.03 μm.",NA,NA,NA,101

The entire process of sporogony takes place in the host musculature. The sporogonic stages are enclosed in the pansporoblastic membrane. In each pansporoblast, sporogony gives rise to 8 sporoblasts; the octonucleate sporogonial plasmodium is lacking. In the course of schizogonic and sporogonic divisions, each kinetic center consists of 2 plaques, one located within and the other outside the nuclear envelope. The dividing sporonts and sporoblasts secrete “metabolic” substances (granules, tubules) which are deposited in the pansporoblast. The uninucleate spore is long and cylindrical, measuring 19.1 X 2.4 pm. A rectilinear manubrium traverses the spore. Its posterior end attenuates abruptly into a polar filament with 4 or 5 coils; its anterior end is attached to the polar cap, which is compressed by a double polar ring.

All stages were found in oenocytes and fat body cells. Meronts were uni- or binucleate with simple surface membranes. The sporogonic stages were recognized ultrastructurally by the separation of an envelope, the sporophorous vesicle, from their surfaces. Mature sporogonial plasmodia were tetranucleate and gave rise by longitudinal fission to four uninucleate elongate sporoblasts with polar nuclei. Spores were lageniform with an inflated posterior end, containing the polar tube coils and the nucleus, and a narrow anterior section comprising two-thirds of the length, containing the polaroplast and straight part of the polar tube. The polaroplast consisted of an anterior region of loosely packed membranes arranged as partitions at angles to one another and a posterior region of increasingly closely packed parallel membranes. The spore wall consisted of an electron-dense exospore with a fuzzy coat and a thin electron-lucent endospore.

Thelohania capillata,"Thelohania Capillata n. Sp. (Microspora, Thelohaniidae) — An Ultrastructural Study with Remarks on the Taxonomy of the Genus Thelohania Henneguy, 1892 ::: Thelohania capillata sp. nov. is described from larvae of the blackfly Odagmia ornata (MEIGEN, 1818), collected in a small stream in the south of Sweden, Infection was restricted to the adipose tissue, which was transformed into a syncytial xenoma. The earliest stage observed was diplo- karyotic merozoites, which mature directly into diplokaryotic sporonts. The first division of the sporont is a meiosis, identified by the occurrence of synaptonemal complexes, and it is usually followed by a mitotical division, resulting in a plasmodium with 8 single nuclei. The cytoplasm is further divided into 8 lobes which finally give rise to 8 rounded sporoblasts. Each sporoblast matures into a barrel-shaped spore, with a spore-wall composed of three layers, 280 - 350 nm thick. Most spores are octosporous microspores, dimensions 2.0-3.1 X 2.0-2.7 um in fixed preparations, but a small number of macrospores, 3.5 -4.5 X 2.8 -3.0 um, are produced in pansporoblasts with four spores. Both spore types with a single nucleus and a nearly identical fine structure. The anehoring disc is small and the straight part of the polar filament reaches the posterior pole of the spore. It is surrounded by a polaroplast composed of two structurally different parts. The anterior part is about 1/3 of the spore length, the posterior about 2/3. The polar filament is of approximately uniform thickness all over its length. In microspores the diameter is 120 -140 nm, in macrospores it is slightly bigger, 125-150 nm. The polar filament of microspores is posteriorly arranged as 4-5 coils in a single layer close to the spore wall. The angle of tilt of the first fila- ment coil is approximately 45 degrees. In macrospores the posterior part of the filament is ar- ranged as 8 irregularly stacked coils. Sporogony occurs in a pansporoblast trans versed by a fibrous material continuous from the spore wall to the pansporoblast membrane, which has a hair-like fibrous appearance.

This microsporidian species is monomorphic, disporous and develops in direct contact with the cytoplasm of the host cell. The nuclear configuration of merogonic and sporogonic stages was diplokaryotic. The merogonic proliferative stage was unusual that normal development with 1, 2 and 4 binucleated forms were common, while large multinucleate meronts containing 8 and 12 small compact horseshoe-like diplokaryotic nuclei were also observed. The fresh spores were typically ovocylindrical in shape, with a mean size of 3·91×1·91 μm and the polar filament length was ~90 μm. Infection was systemic with mature spores produced in the midgut, nervous tissue, muscles, labial glands, gonads, tracheae, epidermis, Malpighian tubules and, most extensively, fat body tissues. The new isolate was highly pathogenic to S. litura larvae. Host specificity tests performed on 37 non-target hosts of 5 different insect orders revealed that the new isolate is pathogenic only to lepidopteran insects. We sequenced the 16S small subunit rRNA (SSU rRNA) gene of the isolate and compared it with 72 non-redundant microsporidian sequences from the GenBank. Based on the light microscopic studies and phylogenetic analyses, the new isolate is assigned to the genus Nosema. Significant differences in the SSU rRNA sequence were identified when compared with the type species Nosema bombycis and other closely related species viz., Nosema spodopterae. Structural differences were also observed in the 16S SSU rRNA between the new isolate and the two above-mentioned microsporidian pathogens.
