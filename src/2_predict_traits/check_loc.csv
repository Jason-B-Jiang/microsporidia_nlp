5,Agglomerata daphnia,"Morphological and molecular characterization of a new species, Agglomerata daphniae n. sp. from the hypoderm of Daphnia magna (Crustacea: Daphniidae) ::: A new microsporidian species was described from the hypoderm of Daphnia magna sampled from gibel carp (Carassius auratus gibelio) ponds located in Wuhan city, China. The infected cladocerans generally appeared opaque due to numerous plasmodia distributed in the host integument. The earliest stages observed were uninucleate meronts that were in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm. Meronts developed into multinucleate sporogonial plasmodia enclosed in sporophorous vesicles. Sporoblasts were produced by the rosette-like division of sporogonial division. Mature spores were pyriform and monokaryotic, measuring 4.48 ± 0.09 (4.34-4.65) µm long and 2.40 ± 0.08 (2.18-2.54) µm wide. The polaroplast was bipartite with loose anterior lamellae and tight posterior lamellae. Polar filaments, arranged in two rows, were anisofilar with two wider anterior coils, and five narrower posterior coils. The exospore was covered with fibrous secretions and was composed of four layers. Phylogenetic analysis based on the obtained SSU rDNA sequence, indicated that the present species clustered with three unidentified Daphnia pulicaria-infecting microsporidia with high support values to form a monophyletic lineage, rather than with the congener, Agglomerata cladocera. The barcode motif of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the novel species was unique among representatives of the ""Agglomeratidae"" sensu clade (Vávra et al., 2018). Based on the morphological characters and SSU rDNA-inferred phylogenetic analyses, a new species was erected and named as Agglomerata daphniae n. sp.

(Microsporidia, Terresporidia), a parasite of Prostephanus truncatus and Dinoderus spp. (Coleoptera, Bostrichidae) ::: A new species and a new genus of a microsporidium Alternosema bostrichidis isolated from an adult Prostephanus truncatus in Mexico and from three species of the genus Dinoderus in Nigeria are described. The microsporidium is monomorphic, monoxenic, and develops in direct contact with host cell cytoplasm. The infection first appears with thoracic muscles, followed by a generalized invasion of the host. All developmental stages are diplokaryotic. Sporogony is disporoblastic. Mature spores are ovoid. Unfixed spores measure 3.7–4.2 × 2.0–2.6 μm, fixed and stained spores 3.5–5.0 × 2.4–2.8 μm. The polaroplast consists of dense lamellae and rare lamellae. The polar tube is slightly anisofilar, consisting of 11–17 coils, with 9–14 proximal (130 nm in diameter) and 2–3 distal coils (120 nm in diameter) arranged in one layer. Molecular phylogenetic analysis based upon a short portion of small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene (Genbank accession # KP455651) placed the new microsporidium within Liebermannia-Orthosomella lineage, which contains multiple undescribed parasites. In particular, A. bostrichidis showed maximal sequence similarity of 95% to Microsporidium sp.

Abstract A survey of mosquito larvae infected with microsporidia was conducted from 2005 to 2008 in the Tomsk, Kemerovo and Novosibirsk regions of western Siberia, Russia. Twenty-one morphologically and genetically unique species of microsporidia were isolated from nine species of Anopheles, Aedes, Culex and Ochlerotatus mosquitoes including: (1) 14 proposed new species of Amblyospora (A. bakcharia, A. baritia, A. bogashovia, A. chulymia, A. hristinia, A. jurginia, A. kazankia, A. mavlukevia, A. mocrushinia, A. modestium, A. salairia, A. severinia, A. shegaria, and A. timirasia); (2) a newly proposed genus and species, Novothelohania ovalae and; (3) six species of Amblyospora (A. flavescens, A. kolarovi, A. rugosa), Parathelohania (P. divulgata and P. tomski) and Trichoctosporea (T. pygopellita) from which gene sequences had not been previously obtained. Detailed ultrastructure of meiospores revealed unique cytological features associated with the length, arrangement and ratio of broad to narrow coils of the polar filament, comparative thickness of the exospore and endospore, and overall size of each species reaffirming their value in distinguishing taxonomic relationships. SSU rDNA sequences obtained from each species of microsporidia were unique when compared with GenBank entries. Phylogenetic trees constructed by Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Neighbor Joining analyses yielded similar topologies with a high degree of congruence between parasite and host at the generic level. Species that parasitize Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Culex mosquitoes segregate into distinct monophyletic groupings mirroring their host phylogeny, while species from Anopheles mosquitoes group as a sister clade basal to the entire group of mosquito-parasitic microsporidia as their Anopheles hosts cluster as a sister clade to the entire group of culicine mosquitoes. This provides strong evidence for host-parasite coevolution by descent at the generic level and limited host lineage switching between unrelated taxa. Among parasites of Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Anopheles mosquitoes, we found several instances where a single mosquito species serves as a host for two or more related species of microsporidia, an observation consistent with host switching and independent parasite speciation. Among the microsporidian parasites of Culex mosquitoes, we found only one parasite per host indicating a higher degree of host specificity and less host switching among parasites of this genus. Findings suggest a degree of host-parasite co-speciation with host switching occurring occasionally when the “normal” host is unavailable in the aquatic ecosystem. Frequency of host switching seems to be occurring in proportion to host relatedness and does not cross generic boundaries in this system.","(pool near the village of Bakchar, Tomsk region, Western Siberia) Russia","Russia (Bakchar, Tomsk, Western Siberia)",Russia (Siberia | Tomsk | Kemerovo | Novosibirsk); Canada (Anopheles); Amblyospora (),2,5,0,TRUE

Meiospores of A. camposi (5.8 x 4.1 μm) were infectious per os to female adults of the copepod P. f. fimbriatus. All developmental stages in the copepod had unpaired nuclei, with sporulation involving the formation of a sub-persistent, sporontogenic, interfacial envelope and the production of a second type of uninucleate spore. These spores, formed in the ovaries of P. f. fimbriatus, were large, pyriform, and measured 10.70 x 3.85 μm. When ingested they infected C. renatoi larvae to initiate a sequence that involves schizogony and gametogony and ends with plasmogamy and nuclear association to form diplokaryotic meronts. Oblong ovate binucleate spores (7.86 x 2.96 μm) are formed in the adult mosquito and are responsible for vertical transmission to the filial generation.

Twenty-one morphologically and genetically unique species of microsporidia were isolated from nine species of Anopheles, Aedes, Culex and Ochlerotatus mosquitoes including: (1) 14 proposed new species of Amblyospora (A. bakcharia, A. baritia, A. bogashovia, A. chulymia, A. hristinia, A. jurginia, A. kazankia, A. mavlukevia, A. mocrushinia, A. modestium, A. salairia, A. severinia, A. shegaria, and A. timirasia); (2) a newly proposed genus and species, Novothelohania ovalae and; (3) six species of Amblyospora (A. flavescens, A. kolarovi, A. rugosa), Parathelohania (P. divulgata and P. tomski) and Trichoctosporea (T. pygopellita) from which gene sequences had not been previously obtained. Detailed ultrastructure of meiospores revealed unique cytological features associated with the length, arrangement and ratio of broad to narrow coils of the polar filament, comparative thickness of the exospore and endospore, and overall size of each species reaffirming their value in distinguishing taxonomic relationships. SSU rDNA sequences obtained from each species of microsporidia were unique when compared with GenBank entries. Phylogenetic trees constructed by Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Neighbor Joining analyses yielded similar topologies with a high degree of congruence between parasite and host at the generic level. Species that parasitize Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Culex mosquitoes segregate into distinct monophyletic groupings mirroring their host phylogeny, while species from Anopheles mosquitoes group as a sister clade basal to the entire group of mosquito-parasitic microsporidia as their Anopheles hosts cluster as a sister clade to the entire group of culicine mosquitoes. This provides strong evidence for host-parasite coevolution by descent at the generic level and limited host lineage switching between unrelated taxa. Among parasites of Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Anopheles mosquitoes, we found several instances where a single mosquito species serves as a host for two or more related species of microsporidia, an observation consistent with host switching and independent parasite speciation. Among the microsporidian parasites of Culex mosquitoes, we found only one parasite per host indicating a higher degree of host specificity and less host switching among parasites of this genus. Findings suggest a degree of host-parasite co-speciation with host switching occurring occasionally when the “normal” host is unavailable in the aquatic ecosystem. Frequency of host switching seems to be occurring in proportion to host relatedness and does not cross generic boundaries in this system.","(pool near the village of Ursk, Komerovo region, Western Siberia) Russia","Russia (Ursk, Western Siberia)",Russia (Siberia | Tomsk | Kemerovo | Novosibirsk); Canada (Anopheles); Amblyospora (),2,6,0,TRUE

Detailed ultrastructure of meiospores revealed unique cytological features associated with the length, arrangement and ratio of broad to narrow coils of the polar filament, comparative thickness of the exospore and endospore, and overall size of each species reaffirming their value in distinguishing taxonomic relationships. SSU rDNA sequences obtained from each species of microsporidia were unique when compared with GenBank entries. Phylogenetic trees constructed by Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Neighbor Joining analyses yielded similar topologies with a high degree of congruence between parasite and host at the generic level. Species that parasitize Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Culex mosquitoes segregate into distinct monophyletic groupings mirroring their host phylogeny, while species from Anopheles mosquitoes group as a sister clade basal to the entire group of mosquito-parasitic microsporidia as their Anopheles hosts cluster as a sister clade to the entire group of culicine mosquitoes. This provides strong evidence for host-parasite coevolution by descent at the generic level and limited host lineage switching between unrelated taxa. Among parasites of Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Anopheles mosquitoes, we found several instances where a single mosquito species serves as a host for two or more related species of microsporidia, an observation consistent with host switching and independent parasite speciation.

Diplokaryotic meronts, which divided by binary fission, were distinguished at the electron microscope level by their unthickened plasma membranes. Sporonts with an electron-dense surface coat gave rise to eight uninucleate sporoblasts within a sporophorous vesicle, cytoplasmic division occurring at the quadrinucleate or octonucleate stages. Indications that nuclear fusion and chromosome reorganization occurred in merogony and sporogony were obtained by light microscopy but meiosis was not detected at the ultrastructural level. Spores were typical of Amblyospora, being ovoid when fresh, truncate when stained, and having an exospore of two membranous layers subtended by a thick amorphous layer, an electron-lucent endospore, an anisofilar polar filament, and a polaroplast comprised of an anterior region of close-packed lamellae and a posterior region of expanded sacs. The metabolic products in the sporophorous vesicle took the form of large globules, small globules with electron-dense borders, and fine granules. These were depleted in mature sporophorous vesicles, though a surface layer of fine granules on the spores may have been derived from them. Many stages were degenerate and it is suggested that C. pipiens may be an accidental host in which the parasite could develop suboptimally in nervous tissue only.

This species was found to be heterosporous with two concurrent sporulation sequences in the host larvae, both arising from diplokaryotic meronts and ending with haploid spores. One sequence was dominant and involved meiosis to produce eight thick‐walled, broadly oval meiospores in a sporophorous vesicle (SV). The other sequence involved nuclear dissociation to produce lanceolate, thin‐walled spores in a subpersistent SV.

Since 1998, Dungeness crabs exhibiting pink- to orange-colored joints and opaque white musculature have been sporadically observed in low prevalence from the Fraser River delta of British Columbia, Canada. We provide histological, ultrastructural, and molecular evidence that this condition is caused by a new microsporidian parasite. Crabs displaying gross symptoms were confirmed to have heavy infections of ovoid-shaped microsporidian spores (~1.8 × 1.4 µm in size) within muscle bundles of the skeletal musculature. The parasite apparently infected the outer periphery of each muscle bundle, and then proliferated into the muscle fibres near the centre of each infected bundle. Light infections were observed in heart tissues, and occasionally spores were observed within the fixed phagocytes lining the blood vessels of the hepatopancreas. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed multiple life stages of a monokaryotic microsporidian parasite within the sarcoplasm of muscle fibres. Molecular analysis of partial small subunit rRNA sequence data from the new species revealed an affinity to Ameson, a genus of Microsporidia infecting marine crustaceans. Based on morphological and molecular data, the new species is distinct from Nadelspora canceri, a related microsporidian that also infects the muscles of this host.

Sporogony and spore ultrastructure of this microsporidium differed from that of known microsporidian species, suggesting establishment of a new species, Anisofilariata chironomi, being a type species of a new genus. Sporogony di-, tetra-, octo-, and 16-sporoblastic. Fixed and stained spores are 4.7-6.8 x 3.4-5.4 microm in size, the spore measurements varying depending upon the number of spores in the sporophorous vesicle.

Molecular analyses revealed the two species belong to a clade of microsporidian parasites that preferentially infect the intestinal epithelium of insect and crustacean hosts. These parasites are morphologically distinguishable from other gut microsporidia infecting Artemia. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. Fixed spores measure 1·3×0·7 μm with 5–6 polar tube coils for A. rigaudi and 1·2×0·9 μm with 4 polar tube coils for E. artemiae. Transmission of both species is horizontal, most likely through the ingestion of spores released with the faeces of infected hosts. The minute size of these species, together with their intestinal localization, makes their detection and identification difficult. We developed two species-specific molecular markers allowing each type of infection to be detected within 3–6 days post-inoculation. Using these markers, we show that the prevalence of these microsporidia ranges from 20% to 75% in natural populations. Hence, this study illustrates the usefulness of molecular approaches to study prevalent, but cryptic, infections involving microsporidian parasites of gut tissues.",Southern France; Ukraine,France (); Ukraine (),France (); Anostracospora (); United Kingdom (Sterling),1,3,1,TRUE

Phylogenetic and morphological distinction from other known lineages within the phylum also provide strong support for erection of a new family (Areosporiidae n. fam) to contain the parasite. Recognised via lesions observed by workers in king crab processing facilities in southern Chile, the parasite elicits giant cell formation in infected crabs. Merogony within haemocytes and fixed phagocytes proceeds apparent fusion of infected cells to produce multinucleate syncitia in which further development of the parasite occurs. Subsequent recruitment of adjacent cells within the haemal spaces of the hepatopancreas, the podocytes of the gill, and particularly in the subcuticular connective tissues, characterises the pathogenesis of A. rohanae. In late stages of infection, significant remodelling of the subcuticular tissues corresponds to the clinical lesions observed within processing plants. Sporogony of A. rohanae also occurs within the syncitial cytoplasm and culminates in production of bizarre spores, ornamented with distinctive tubular bristles. Spores occur in sets of 8 within a sporophorous vesicle. The description of A. rohanae offers considerable insight into the pathogenesis of giant-cell forming Microsporidia, signifies a new lineage of giant-cell forming Microsporidia in marine hosts, and may reflect emergence of a commercially-significant pathogen in the southern ocean Lithodes santolla fishery.",(Straits of Magellan) Chile,Chile (Straits of Magellan),Chile (),1,0,1,TRUE

The life cycle of the pathogen includes a merogony with uninucleate stages, a meiotic sequence in part with binucleate stages (diplokarya) and a sporogony resulting in a persistent sporophorous vesicle containing eight spores. Spores are long oval, slightly curved, with broader basis and equally rounded ends, 5 ± 0.5 x 2.5 ± 0.5 μm in diameter. A series ending with early spores serving for autoinfection in the primary host and spread of the infection in other tissues differs in ultrastructure of spores. They are shorter and more constricted apically and measure 4 x 2.5 ± 3 μm.

This species invaded the UK in 2012 and has become widely established. Dikerogammarus haemobaphes has the potential to introduce non-native pathogens into the UK, creating a potential threat to native fauna. This study describes a novel species of microsporidian parasite infecting 72.8% of invasive D. haemobaphes located in the River Trent, UK. The microsporidium infection was systemic throughout the host; mainly targeting the sarcolemma of muscle tissues. Electron microscopy revealed this parasite to be diplokaryotic and have 7–9 turns of the polar filament. The microsporidium is placed into the ‘Cucumispora’ genus based on host histopathology, fine detail parasite ultrastructure, a highly similar life-cycle and SSU rDNA sequence phylogeny. Using this data this novel microsporidian species is named Cucumispora ornata, where ‘ornata’ refers to the external beading present on the mature spore stage of this organism.

131,Cucumispora roeselii,"Parasites, Pathogens and Commensals in the ‘Low-Impact’ Non-Native Amphipod Host Gammarus Roeselii ::: BACKGROUND: Whilst vastly understudied, pathogens of non-native species (NNS) are increasingly recognised as important threats to native wildlife. This study builds upon recent recommendations for improved screening for pathogens in NNS by focusing on populations of Gammarus roeselii in Chojna, north-western Poland. At this location, and in other parts of continental Europe, G. roeselii is considered a well-established and relatively 'low-impact' invader, with little understanding about its underlying pathogen profile and even less on potential spill-over of these pathogens to native species. RESULTS: Using a combination of histological, ultrastructural and phylogenetic approaches, we define a pathogen profile for non-native populations of G. roeselii in Poland. This profile comprised acanthocephalans (Polymorphus minutus Goese, 1782 and Pomphorhynchus sp.), digenean trematodes, commensal rotifers, commensal and parasitic ciliated protists, gregarines, microsporidia, a putative rickettsia-like organism, filamentous bacteria and two viral pathogens, the majority of which are previously unknown to science. To demonstrate potential for such pathogenic risks to be characterised from a taxonomic perspective, one of the pathogens, a novel microsporidian, is described based upon its pathology, developmental cycle and SSU rRNA gene phylogeny. The novel microsporidian Cucumispora roeselii n. sp. displayed closest morphological and phylogenetic similarity to two previously described taxa, Cucumispora dikerogammari (Ovcharenko & Kurandina, 1987), and Cucumispora ornata Bojko, Dunn, Stebbing, Ross, Kerr & Stentiford, 2015. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to our discovery extending the host range for the genus Cucumispora Ovcharenko, Bacela, Wilkinson, Ironside, Rigaud & Wattier, 2010 outside of the amphipod host genus Dikerogammarus Stebbing, we reveal significant potential for the co-transfer of (previously unknown) pathogens alongside this host when invading novel locations. This study highlights the importance of pre-invasion screening of low-impact NNS and, provides a means to document and potentially mitigate the additional risks posed by previously unknown pathogens.",Poland,Poland (),Poland (Europe); Canada (Stebbing); Commensals (); United States (Dunn); Bojko (); Belgium (At),1,9,0,TRUE

All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. The sporogony is polysporoblastic, yielding 4–16 (most commonly 6 or 8) ovocylindrical spores, measuring 1.2–1.5 × 4.6–5.5 μm when fixed and stained. The spore wall has an approximately 43 nm thick, layered exospore with a median layer resembling a double membrane. The polaroplast is uniformly lamellar. The isofilar, 114–123 nm thick, polar filament is arranged in 11–15 (most commonly 12–13) coils in a single layer close to the spore wall. The angle of tilt is approximately 35°. The last coil touches the posterior pole of the spore. A sporophorous vesicle is produced by the sporont. The envelope is generated as a duplication of the plasma membrane. Typically the vesicle primordia grow from one pole of the sporont to the other. The episporontal space initially has granular inclusions. Later septate, persistent tubules of exospore material appear. Simultaneously with the release of sporoblasts, wide tubulus-like, non-persistent structures are formed. They are covered by regularly spaced electron-dense material. Anomalous sporogony was frequently observed, probably caused by a simultaneous parasitism by the fungus Strongwellsea castrans.

Laboratory experiments showed that binucleate spores formed within infected female mosquitoes were responsible for transovarial transmission to the next generation. Sporogony within the larval fat body was initiated by two diplokarya, one at each end of the cell, which undergo meiosis within a single sporophorous vesicle to form 16 meiospores. These spores are responsible for horizontal transmission to the copepod Apocyclops dengizicus. The microsporidium is transmitted back to the mosquito host via uninucleate pyriform spores formed within the copepod host which are infectious to larvae of A. hilli. The meronts within larvae infected by horizontal transmission ultimately develop into the binucleate spores within adult females to complete the life cycle. Thus, the development of this microsporidium involves vertical transmission between successive mosquito generations and horizontal transmission between mosquitoes and copepods similar to the life cycles of Amblyospora and Parathelohania.",Australia (north Queensland),Australia (Queensland),Australia (Queensland); Thelohaniidae (); Amblyospora (); Parathelohania (); Microsporida (),2,4,0,TRUE

Two genera, Endoreticulatus and Cystosporogenes, clearly separate into distinct but closely related clades based on small subunit ribosomal RNA analysis but are included in different families that are each polyphyletic. A microsporidium with morphology resembling the Endoreticulatus/Cystosporogenes clade was isolated from the grasshopper Poecilimon thoracicus from a site in Northwest Bulgaria. It produced intense infections in the digestive tract of the host but no behavioral changes were noted in infected individuals. Prevalence of the microsporidium increased over the active feeding season yearly. Mature spores were oval and measured 2.58±0.21μm×1.34±0.24μm, with 16 to approximately 32 spores in a parasitophorous vacuole. The spores were uninucleate and polar filament coils numbered 8–9 situated in a single row. The spore polaroplast consisted of an anterior lamellar section and a posterior vesicular section, and the posterior vacuole was reduced. Analyses of a 1221bp partial SSU-rRNA sequence indicated that the isolate is more closely related to the Endoreticulatus clade than to Cystosporogenes, but shows earlier phylogenetic separation from species infecting Lepidoptera and represents a new species, Endoreticulatus poecilimonae. To compare sequences of Endoreticulatus spp. from Lepidoptera to those infecting other insect orders, an isolate, Microsporidium itiiti Malone (1985), described from the Argentine stem weevil, Listronotus bonariensis, was sequenced. Like the grasshopper isolate, the weevil isolate is closely related but basal to the lepidopteran Endoreticulatus clade.

Molecular analyses revealed the two species belong to a clade of microsporidian parasites that preferentially infect the intestinal epithelium of insect and crustacean hosts. These parasites are morphologically distinguishable from other gut microsporidia infecting Artemia. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. Fixed spores measure 1·3×0·7 μm with 5–6 polar tube coils for A. rigaudi and 1·2×0·9 μm with 4 polar tube coils for E. artemiae. Transmission of both species is horizontal, most likely through the ingestion of spores released with the faeces of infected hosts. The minute size of these species, together with their intestinal localization, makes their detection and identification difficult. We developed two species-specific molecular markers allowing each type of infection to be detected within 3–6 days post-inoculation. Using these markers, we show that the prevalence of these microsporidia ranges from 20% to 75% in natural populations.

Infection is restricted to the adipose tissue. Infected cells and their nuclei are hypertrophied, and in the final phase disintegrated. In the merogonial development multinucleate plasmodia with isolated nuclei give rise to numerous uninucleate merozoites, which mature to uninucleate sporonts. The tetranucleate sporogonial plasmodium is divided into four symmetrical lobes, and finally four rounded uninucleate sporoblasts are budded off. Sporogonial plasmodium and sporoblasts are enclosed in a sporophorous vesicle, produced by the sporont, with a thin electron-dense envelope and a fibrillar content. The vesicle is subpersistent and disappears at spore maturation. Mature spores are always free and ungrouped, even in situ in the host. Spores are pyriform, c. 2.1 X 2.5-3.2 Itm unfixed, 1.2-1.6 X 2.1-2.6,am fixed and stained. The membrane-lined posterior vacuole is visible also in unfixed spores, in an oblique position close to the posterior pole. The uninucleate spores have a polaroplast with two lamellar parts. The anterior lamellae are wide, the posterior ones narrow. The polar filament is anisofilar, with 3 wide (130-140 nm) anterior coils and 2 to 3 narrow (108-113 nm) posterior coils in a single layer close to the spore wall. The angle of tilt is acute, 30-35 degrees. The spore wall is 187-194 nm thick. The internal plasmalemma is c. 10 nm thick and the electron-translucent endospore - 100 nm. The plurilayered exospore has two c. 16 nm thick internal layers of somewhat different electron densities, and a 54 nm thick reticulate or chambered coat, with approximately 10 nm wide compartments and a 6 nm thick cover resembling a unit membrane.

Large numbers of spherical whitish xenomas were observed throughout the visceral organs of the host. Histological examination showed that the microsporidia caused several xenomas that were embedded in the intestinal muscularis externa or submucosa. Light and transmission electron microscopy examination of the spores also revealed morphological features typical of species of Glugea Thélohan, 1891. This microsporidian parasite has two different types of mature spores: microspores and macrospores. The spores are elongate-ovoid, with a large posterior vacuole. The polaroplast is bi-partite, with anterior and posterior parts comprising densely packed lamellae and loose membranes, respectively, and occupies approximately the anterior half of the spore. The polar filament is anisofilar, with 12–13 coils in a single layer almost touching the posterior spore wall. Comparison of the small subunit rDNA sequences revealed 92.7–98.1% identity with the sequences available from other Glugea spp. from piscine hosts. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the microsporidian species studied clustered within the Glugea clade with strong support.

In a heavy infection of the parasite xenomas develop in large number in various organs, viz., peritoneum, visceral cavity, ovaries, testis, fat body, pyloric caeca, spleen, muscle, liver, heart, gills, iris, etc., and cause serious damage to fish. The xenomas are variable in size, being 0.5-3 mm, rarely as large as 5 mm. Fresh spores of the parasite are elongate or ellipsoidal and are 5.1-6.2 x 2.0-2.5µ, the average of 200 spores being 5.8 x 2.1 Spores fixed in Bouin's solution and stained with Heidenhein's iron hematoxylin are 3.S-4.8 x 1.5-2.0 µ the average of 50 spores being 4.0 X 1.8 µ. Everted filaments are 180 µ at maximum, being 100-150 µ in the majority. The processes of schizogony and sporogony of the parasite studied with artificially infected ayu are in substance the same as those reported by Weissenberg (1968) on Glugea anomala and by Sprague and Yernick (1968) on G. weissenbergu A very small xenoma of 4x8 µ with a single schizont and a single host cell nucleus was found in the lamina propria of the villi of the gut of an ayu killed 5 days after infection. Sporonts in smear preparations of parasite are 3 x 4 µ and each sporont produce two spores. Therefore the parasite is classified into the genus Glugea. Inoculation experiments have shown that Salmo gairdneri is susceptible to the parasite, but. Gasterosteus acelatus microcephalus is unsusceptible. Of about 15 species of Glugea in fish, G. hertwigi has spores similar in size to those of the present Glugea, But the former differs from the latter in the following points.

The microsporidian formed large whitish xenomas adhering to the peritoneal visceral organs of the host. Each xenoma consisted of a single hypertrophic cell, in the cytoplasm of which mature spores proliferated within parasitophorous vacuoles surrounded by numerous collagen fibers. Mature spores were ellipsoidal and uninucleated, measuring an average of 6.5 ± 0.5 μm in length and 3.4 ± 0.6 μm in width. The anchoring disk of the polar filament was subterminal, laterally shifted from the anterior pole of the spore. The isofilar polar filament coiled in 18–19 turns, forming two rows that surrounded the posterior vacuole. The latter occupied about one third of the spore length. The polaroplast surrounding the apical and uncoiled portion of the polar filament displayed two distinct regions: a lamellar region and an electron-dense globule. Molecular analysis of the rRNA genes, including the internal transcribed spacer region, and phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and neighbor joining demonstrated that this microsporidian parasite clustered with some Glugea species.

(Microsporidia: Glugeidae) infecting the Australian marine fish Vincentia conspersa (Teleostei: Apogonidae) ::: A parasite of the marine fish Vincentia conspersa was examined by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. This parasite develops in the subcutaneous tissue of the body and fins, forming spherical xenomas about 1-2 mm in diameter surrounded by a layer of amorphous material. The observed characteristics of the new parasite are in line with those of the other Glugea species; merogony takes place in the outer zone of the cytoplasm of the host cell, sporogony takes place in sporophorous vesicles, and mature spores are located in the central part of the xenoma. Meronts were cylindrical uninucleate or occasionally triradiate multinucleate, with plasmodia in direct contact with the host cytoplasm. Sporogonic plasmodia divided by multiple cleavage to produce sporoblast mother cells, which after binary fission became sporoblasts. Two types of spores were recognized, both uninucleate, i.e., ovoid or slightly ovoid microspores with a mean size of 5.1 × 2.2 μm and much less frequent as elongated oval macrospores with a mean size of 8.9 × 3.1 μm. The polar tube has between 12 and 14 coils arranged in 1, 2, or 3 layers.

This parasite was previously identified as Octosporea bayeri Jírovec, 1936 and has become a model system to study the ecology, epidemiology, evolution and genomics of microsporidia - host interactions. Here, we present evidence that shows its differences from O. bayeri. Hamiltosporidium tvaerminnensis exclusively infects the adipose tissue, the ovaries and the hypodermis of Daphnia magna and is found only in host populations located in coastal rock pool populations in Finland and Sweden. Merogonial stages of H. tvaerminnensis have isolated nuclei; merozoites are formed by binary fission or by the cleaving of a plasmodium with a small number of nuclei. A sporogonial plasmodium with isolated nuclei yields 8 sporoblasts. Elongated spores are generated by the most finger-like plasmodia. The mature spores are polymorphic in shape and size. Most spores are pyriform (4·9–5·6×2·2–2·3 μm) and have their polar filament arranged in 12–13 coils. A second, elongated spore type (6·8–12·0×1·6–2·1 μm) is rod-shaped with blunt ends and measures 6·8–12·0×1·6–2·1 μm. The envelope of the sporophorous vesicle is thin and fragile, formed at the beginning of the sporogony. Cytological and molecular comparisons with Flabelliforma magnivora, a parasite infecting the same tissues in the same host species, reveal that these two species are very closely related, yet distinct. Moreover, both cytological and molecular data indicate that these species are quite distant from F. montana, the type species of the genus Flabelliforma.

Infection was restricted to the adipose tissue which was transformed into a syncytium. The earliest stage observed was diplokaryotic merozoites, which mature directly into diplokaryotic sporonts. Each sporont produces a sporophorous vesicle (pansporoblast), which persists, also enclosing mature spores. Usually nuclear divisions result in a plasmodium with 8 nuclei, which fragments into 8 sporoblasts, each of which develops into a spore without further division. Occasionally an aberrant number of spores (2, 4, 6) is formed. The spores are pyriform with a flattened area at the posterior pole. Spores in sporophorous vesicles with 8 spores are 4.0-6.0 μm long, in vesicles with 4 spores 4.0-5.0 μm, and in vesicles with 2 spores 7.0-8.0 μm. In some vesicles the spores develop asynchronously, and 2, 4, or 6 mature spores are found together with 6, 4, or 2 immature. There was also a small number of vesicles with supernumerary spores, less than 8 normally developed. The 325-350 nm thick spore wall is composed of three layers.

Two different types of haploid spores, one oval and the other lanceolate, were concurrently produced in the infected larvae. Merogony preceding the sequence leading to oval meiospores ended with the formation of a binucleate sporont with similar ultrastructural features to meronts. Synaptonemal complexes, suggesting that meiosis was involved during this sporogony, appeared in both nuclei of the sporont. The polar filament in the mature meiospore was anisofilar. Nine coiled turns of the polar filament were shown turning about the posterior portion of the spore. The polaroplast was composed of an anterior lamellate part and a posterior vesicular part. The anchoring disc was at the top of the straight portion of the polar filament. The meront of the lanceolate spore cannot be confirmed in this study. Two uninucleate lanceolate spores were eventually formed via nuclear dissociation. The polaroplast of the lanceolate spore was divided into an anterior multi-chambered part and a posterior of reticulate part. The polar filament was of the isofilar type, consisting of at least 5-6 coils. This parasite was extremely similar to the species Amblyospora trinus; in spore shape and development; but different in spore size and their hosts.

Merogonial stages and sporonts are diplokaryotic. Merozoites are formed by rosette‐like division. Sporonts develop into sporogonial plasmodia with isolated nuclei. These plasmodia give rise to 8–16 sporoblasts by rosette‐like budding. A sporophorous vesicle is initiated by the sporogonial plasmodium. Sporoblasts and spores are enclosed in individual sporophorous vesicles. Granular inclusions of the vesicles, visible using light microscopy, discriminate sporogonial stages from stages of the merogony. The monokaryotic, fresh spores are oval with blunt ends, measuring 4.2‐6.3 × 9.1‐11.2 μm. Macrospores are formed in small numbers. The spore wall has three subdivisions and the exospore is electron‐dense. The polaroplast has two parts: closely arranged lamellae anteriorly, wider sac‐like compartments posteriorly. The isofilar polar filament, 191–264 nm wide, has 12‐13 coils, which are arranged in one layer in the posterior half of the spore. The electron‐dense inclusions of the sporophorous vesicle are modified during sporogony, and vesicles with mature spores are traversed by 21–27 nm wide tubules, which connect the exospore with the envelope of the vesicle.

Infected chironomid larvae with hypertrophied adipose tissue exhibited porcelain-white. All developmental stages possessed large nuclei. The earliest stages observed were diplokaryotic meronts which were in direct contact with the host adipocyte cytoplasm. Diplokaryotic meronts developed into sporonts with the deposition of electron-dense coagulum on their surface. Multinucleate sporogonial plasmodia developed into uninucleate sporoblasts by the rosette-like division. Mature spores were oval and monokaryotic, measuring 6.14 ± 0.27 (5.65-6.67) µm long and 3.71 ± 0.12 (3.43-3.98) µm wide.

Several other parasites (Cryptocotyle sp., protozoan ciliates and Gyrodactylus sp.) were also found in gills. In June 2013, the mortality in a farmed lumpfish population increased to 65%. Lumpfish showed erratic swimming behaviour and loss of weight. At necropsy, nodules in the kidney were the only visible lesions. Histologically, all fish showed severe changes with gill inflammation and necrosis in the spleen, kidney and liver. Haemorrhages and necrosis were observed in some hearts. Intracellular microsporidians associated with the lesions were detected in most organs using histological examination and Calcofluor White.

Infection was restricted to the salivary gland epithelial cells. The microsporidium produced ovocylindrical spores averaging 2.6±0.28×1.4±0.12μm (range 2.2–3.4×1.1–1.7μm), which resembled in size and shape the spores of Liebermannia patagonica and L. dichroplusae, two recently described species that also parasitize Argentine grasshoppers. The life cycle of the microsporidium included the formation of polynucleate, diplokaryotic, moniliform, merogonial plasmodia wrapped in flattened cisterns of the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Plasmodia divided to produce diplokaryotic cells. The latter underwent elongation, dissociation of diplokarya counterparts, vacuolization, dismantling of the host ER envelope, and deposition of electron-dense material outside the plasma membrane. The resultant binucleate sporogonial plasmodia divided into two uninucleate sporoblasts, which eventually transformed into spores. Uninucleate spores contained a lamellar polaroplast, embraced by an elongated polar sac, anchoring disc, 3–5 polar filament coils, and a cluster of anastomizing tubules (sporoblast trans-Golgi, posterosome) at the posterior end. Sequence similarity of the SSU rDNA of the newly discovered microsporidium (Genbank accession no. Download EU709818) to L. patagonica and L. dichroplusae was 99% and 97%, respectively, suggesting that the three species belong to one genus. All three species fell into one clade in SSU rDNA-based phylogenetic trees produced by neighbor joining, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood analyses with 100% statistical support. We assign the name Liebermannia covasacrae to this microsporidium. It can be easily differentiated from both congeners by host species, tissue tropism, type of sporogony, and several features of morphology. Comparison of the three Liebermannia spp. demonstrates that the nuclear phase (dikaryotic versus monokaryotic spores) and type of sporogony (polysporous versus disporous) may vary in closely related species.",Argentina,Argentina (),Argentina (Laprida | Buenos Aires); Orthoptera (),1,3,0,TRUE

Mortalities of varying severity occur at this hatchery every fall, and the microsporidian was noted during an experiment from August 1991 to January 1992 to determine the effects of water source on disease. Infections first appeared to be systemic in the October sample; xenomas were observed in heart, spleen, and peripheral vessel walls. The presence of unidentified intracellular material preceded the appearance of xenomas in all tissues, but whether this material was associated with inflammation or represented immature stages of the parasite has yet to be determined. These structures were also noted in the intestine and liver, although xenomas were not noted in these organs. Mature xenomas did not elicit an inflammatory response but appeared to be short-lived. When the xenoma wall ruptured and released spores, an inflammatory response was again observed. The prevalence and severity of the infection were determined in fish maintained in troughs with well water, Chattahoochee River water, or hatchery (treated river) water. The infection tended to be more prevalent and more severe in fish maintained in the hatchery or river water than in those maintained in the well water.

292,Merocinta davidii,"Ultrastructure and life cycle of Merocinta davidii gen et sp. nov, a dimorphic microsporidian parasite of Mansonia africana (Diptera: Culicidae) from Tanzania ::: Mansonia africana larvae were sampled at three sites in NE Tanzania, between June and September 1987. At each site between 2.5 and 5.7% were infected with a multisporous microsporidian parasite. The ovoid spores measured 2.5 × 1.5 •m. Meronts were diplokaryotic with electron-dense, thickened unit membranes. Repeated division of the diplokarya gave rise to multinucleate plasmodia, the plasma membrane of which was entirely surrounded by two other membranes interpreted as host endoplasmic reticulum. Both membranes were studded with ribosomes. Meronts became ribbon-like before division, the endoplasmic reticulum dividing with the parasite. At the onset of sporogony the two nuclei of the diplokaryon separated and the electron-dense coat was sloughed off. Nuclear division and cytoplasmic division gave rise to uninucleate sporoblasts and spores. Adult M. africana collected at one of the three sites were infected with two diplokaryotic microsporidia, designated Type A and Type B, which differed only in the size of the spores. Spores of Type A measured 3.4 ×1.8 •m and those of Type B measured 6.6 × 2.9 •m; both types were binucleate. Type A infected 10.8 and Type B 5.8% of the adults collected. Mixed infections were not observed. In transovarial transmission trials, larvae were not successfully reared from adults infected with Type B. However, 11.3% of progeny from females infected with Type A exhibited multisporous microsporidian infections indistinguishable from those found in larvae collected at that site, showing that the multisporous parasite in larvae and the Type A infection of adults represent different stages in the life cycle of a single species.

This parasite developed in the liver forming whitish xenomas that contained different developmental stages with monokaryotic nuclei. The periphery of the xenoma presented some vacuolization and possessed several small projections in the membrane. The mature spores, measuring 3·8 ± 0·4 μm in length and 2·4 ± 0·4 μm in width, were slightly pyriform to ellipsoidal and had rounded ends. The polaroplast was bipartite and the isofilar polar filament was coiled with 8 – 9 turns in a single or double row at the posterior end of the spore. The nucleus was voluminous and in a central position, measuring ∼0·9 μm in diameter. A large posterior vacuole appeared as a pale area, occupying about a third of the spore length. The SSU rRNA gene was sequenced and analysed using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and neighbour-joining methods.

The microsporidian forms macroscopic xenomas in the host liver which are packed with mature spores. Mature spores are slightly pyriform to oval in shape measuring 3.92 ± 0.21 μm in length and 2.87 ±0.16 pm in width. No pre-spore stages were observed during electron microscopy studies and mature spores had a single nucleus and 12-13 turns of an isofilar polar filament, arranged in two rows. Sequencing of the ribosomal DNA indicated a strong phylogenetic relationship within the Tetramicridae and to other members of the genus Microgemma. The most similar species in terms of genetic distance is M. carolinus with a similarity of 99.23% over 1295 bases of the small subunit of ribosomal DNA. However, differences in the number of turns of the polar filament combined with host and geographical differences, support M. tilanpasiri as a novel microsporidian species. This represents the first description of Microgemma from the Western Pacific and the first from the Gobiidae family of fishes. Related blackfin eel gobies from the same sampling site were found to be uninfected with M. tilanpasiri; however one fish was infected with Glugea sp. in the visceral mesentery.

Minimal estimates of the prevalence of the parasite in fishes caught along Tunisian coasts were as high as 43 % for Bizerte samples (over 2 yr) and 72 % for Monastir samples (over 3 yr). Developmental stages were dispersed within a xenoma structure that was bounded only by the plasma membrane of the hypertrophic host cell. Ultrastructural features support allocation to the genus Microgemma Ralphs and Matthews, 1986. Meronts were multinucleate plasmodia and were surrounded by rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) of the host cell. Merogonic plasmodia developed into sporogonic plasmodia, with loss of the RER interface. Sporogony was polysporoblastic. Ovocylindrical spores (3.6 x 1.2 μm) harbored a lamellar polaroplast and a polar tube that was coiled 9 times. Spore features and host specificity led us to propose a new species, Microgemma tincae. The conversion of M. tincae xenomas into well-visible cyst structures or granulomas reflected an efficient host response involving the infiltration of phagocytic cells, degradation of various parasite stages and formation of a thick fibrous wall.

Twenty three (30.6 %) out of 75 of the examined fish were parasitized with a microsporidian parasite. Numerous macroscopic whitish cysts embedded in the peritoneal cavity were observed to infect many organs of the body including muscles, connective tissues, and the intestinal epithelium. The infection was developed as tumor-like masses of often up to 5 mm in diameter inducing an enormous hypertrophy to the infected organs. Fresh spores appeared mostly ovoid to pyriform in shape reaching a size of 1.7 ± 0.5 (1.5–2.5) μm × 1.3 ± 0.4 (1–2) μm; they possessed a large vacuole at the posterior end. These spores were located within a sporophorous vesicle which was bound by a thick amorphous wall. The ultrastructural features support the placement of the present species within the genus Microsporidium. The developmental stages were enclosed within a xenoma structure that was bounded by a double-layered cyst wall. The life cycle of the microsporidian pathogen described herein included four stages: proliferation (merogony), sporogony, sporoblast, spores, and liberation. Mature spores appeared electron dense, uninucleate, and were ellipsoidal in shape. At the anterior end of the spore, the anchoring disk was found in a central position. There was a definite number (5–11) of turns of the polar tube. A 538-bp region of the SSU rDNA gene of the studied species was sequenced (GenBank accession number: KF0220444).

Metanephrops challengeri were captured from an important marine fishery situated off the south coast of New Zealand. Infected lobsters displayed an unusual external appearance and were lethargic. Histology was used to demonstrate replacement of skeletal and other muscles by merogonic and sporogonic stages of the parasite, while transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of diplokaryotic meronts, sporonts, sporoblasts and spore stages, all in direct contact with the host sarcoplasm. Analysis of the ssrDNA gene sequence from the lobster microsporidian suggested a close affinity with Thelohania butleri, a morphologically dissimilar microsporidian from marine shrimps. Whilst morphological features of the lobster parasite are consistent with members of the family Nosematidae, molecular data place the parasite closer to members of the family Thelohanidae. Due to the contradiction between morphological and molecular taxonomic data, we propose the erection of a new genus in which the lobster parasite is the type species (Myospora metanephrops). Furthermore, we recommend the erection of a new family (Myosporidae) and a new order (Crustaceacida) to contain this genus.

Plurinucleate Plasmodia with nuclei arranged as diplokarya divide, probably by plasmotomy, producing a small number of diplokaryotic merozoites. The number of merogonial cycles is unknown. Each diplokaryotic sporont yields eight monokaryotic sporoblasts in a thin‐walled, more or less fusiform sporophorous vesicle. A small number of multisporoblastic sporophorous vesicles were observed, in which a part of the sporoblasts were anomalous. The sporogony probably begins with a meiotic division. The mature spores are slightly pyriform. Fixed and stained spores measure 2.1‐2.4 × 3.7‐4.5 μm. The five‐layered spore wall is of the Napamichum type. The polar filament is anisofilar with seven to eight coils (142‐156 and 120 nm wide). The angle of tilt is 55‐65°. The polaroplast has an anterior lamellar and a posterior tubular part.

375,Nosema adaliae,"Nosema adaliae sp. nov., a new microsporidian pathogen from the two-spotted lady beetle, Adalia bipunctata L. (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and its relationship to microsporidia that infect other coccinellids ::: Graphical abstract Highlights • This is the first formal description of a microsporidium from Adalia bipunctata. • Diplokaryotic spores (6.10×3.01μm) had isofilar polar filaments with 10–18 coils. • Flight muscles and fat body were the most heavily infected host tissues. • The genome sequence of the microsporidium was 97% similar to Nosema bombi. Abstract The two-spotted lady beetle, Adalia bipunctata L., is a tree-dwelling lady beetle endemic to parts of Europe, Central Asia and North America that is commercially available for aphid control in Europe and North America. Lady beetles host a wide variety of symbionts including parasitoids, viruses, eugregarines, fungi, bacteria, nematodes and microsporidia. Four species of microsporidia have been described from lady beetles, and an undescribed microsporidium was recently isolated from local populations of A. bipunctata in Nova Scotia, Canada. In a previous study, this pathogen prolonged the development of A. bipunctata larvae but had no effect on adult fecundity, longevity or sex ratios. The objective of this study was to formally describe the microsporidium by means of its ultrastructure, tissue pathology and molecular characterization. All stages of the microsporidium were diplokaryotic and developed in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm. Mature spores measured 4.25±0.09×1.82±0.03μm (SE, n=49, from micrographs) and fresh spores measured 6.10±0.06×3.01±0.05μm (±SE, n=60; range: 5.0–6.9×2.18–3.86μm). The polar filament was isofilar with 10–18 coils that were frequently arranged in a single row. The lamellar polaroplast was not typically visible and spores contained a relatively small posterior vacuole. Both the flight muscles and fat body were heavily infected and a large number of spores were observed within and between the cells of these tissues. The ovaries, developing oocytes, spermatocytes and accessory glands within the testes, midgut epithelium, Malpighian tubules, ileum, colon, and ventral nerve cord were also infected but not as heavily.

Collected in Portugal ::: A microsporidium Nosema portugal n. sp. was isolated from gypsy moths, Lymantria dispar L, collected near Lisbon, Portugal, in 1985. The Life cycle includes two sequential developmental cycles, a primary and a secondary cycle. The primary cycle occurs in midgut epithelial cells, where primary spores are produced within 48 h. The primary spores immediately extrude their polar filaments, presumably to infect other cells. In the target tissues (salivary glands and fat body) the secondary development cycle is followed by the formation of environmental spores. Primary spores were also sometimes present in target tissues. Fresh unfixed and unstained primary spores have a large posterior vacuole and measured 4.8 x 2.7 mu m. Ultrastructurally, they have 5-8 polar filament coils, a large posterior vacuole, abundant endoplasmic reticulum, and were binucleate.

Abstract A survey of mosquito larvae infected with microsporidia was conducted from 2005 to 2008 in the Tomsk, Kemerovo and Novosibirsk regions of western Siberia, Russia. Twenty-one morphologically and genetically unique species of microsporidia were isolated from nine species of Anopheles, Aedes, Culex and Ochlerotatus mosquitoes including: (1) 14 proposed new species of Amblyospora (A. bakcharia, A. baritia, A. bogashovia, A. chulymia, A. hristinia, A. jurginia, A. kazankia, A. mavlukevia, A. mocrushinia, A. modestium, A. salairia, A. severinia, A. shegaria, and A. timirasia); (2) a newly proposed genus and species, Novothelohania ovalae and; (3) six species of Amblyospora (A. flavescens, A. kolarovi, A. rugosa), Parathelohania (P. divulgata and P. tomski) and Trichoctosporea (T. pygopellita) from which gene sequences had not been previously obtained. Detailed ultrastructure of meiospores revealed unique cytological features associated with the length, arrangement and ratio of broad to narrow coils of the polar filament, comparative thickness of the exospore and endospore, and overall size of each species reaffirming their value in distinguishing taxonomic relationships. SSU rDNA sequences obtained from each species of microsporidia were unique when compared with GenBank entries. Phylogenetic trees constructed by Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Neighbor Joining analyses yielded similar topologies with a high degree of congruence between parasite and host at the generic level. Species that parasitize Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Culex mosquitoes segregate into distinct monophyletic groupings mirroring their host phylogeny, while species from Anopheles mosquitoes group as a sister clade basal to the entire group of mosquito-parasitic microsporidia as their Anopheles hosts cluster as a sister clade to the entire group of culicine mosquitoes. This provides strong evidence for host-parasite coevolution by descent at the generic level and limited host lineage switching between unrelated taxa. Among parasites of Aedes/Ochlerotatus and Anopheles mosquitoes, we found several instances where a single mosquito species serves as a host for two or more related species of microsporidia, an observation consistent with host switching and independent parasite speciation. Among the microsporidian parasites of Culex mosquitoes, we found only one parasite per host indicating a higher degree of host specificity and less host switching among parasites of this genus. Findings suggest a degree of host-parasite co-speciation with host switching occurring occasionally when the “normal” host is unavailable in the aquatic ecosystem. Frequency of host switching seems to be occurring in proportion to host relatedness and does not cross generic boundaries in this system.","(pool located near the village of Troitskoe, Novosibirsk region, Western Siberia) Russia","Russia (Troitskoe, Novosibirsk, Western Siberia)",Russia (Siberia | Tomsk | Kemerovo | Novosibirsk); Canada (Anopheles); Amblyospora (),2,5,0,TRUE

The crab was sampled from within its invasive range in Atlantic Canada (Nova Scotia). Histopathology and transmission electron microscopy were used to show the development of the parasite within a simple interfacial membrane, culminating in the formation of unikaryotic spores with 5–6 turns of an isofilar polar filament. Formation of a multinucleate meront (>12 nuclei observed) preceded thickening and invagination of the plasmodial membrane, and in many cases, formation of spore extrusion precursors (polar filaments, anchoring disk) prior to complete separation of pre-sporoblasts from the sporogonial plasmodium. This developmental feature is intermediate between the Enterocytozoonidae (formation of spore extrusion precursors within the sporont plasmodium) and all other Microsporidia (formation of spore extrusion precursors after separation of sporont from the sporont plasmodium). SSU rRNA-based gene phylogenies place P. carcini within microsporidian Clade IV, between the Enterocytozoonidae and the so-called Enterocytospora-clade, which includes Enterocytospora artemiae and Globulispora mitoportans. Both of these groups contain gut-infecting microsporidians of aquatic invertebrates, fish and humans.

The larvae were maintained under laboratory conditions in salt concentrations of 10 g/l and 20 g/l of water. Daily recordings of the mortality of the larvae were made and the dates of change of instar were noted. Infected larvae were processed for transmission electronic microscopy using conventional methods at pH 7.2 and 260 mOsm/l. The infection by the microsporidia was positively correlated with an increase in the mean duration of the fourth instar of 2.88 to 6.33 days in 10 g/l of salt and of 2.47 to 6.14 days in 20 g/l of salt. Larval mortality also increased by approximately 50% during this instar in both salt concentrations. Development time and survival were not affected during the other immature stages. The mature spores found in the intestines of infected larvae were barrel shaped and measured approximately 2.6 x 2.4 mm. The exospore has a collar shaped prolongation at the posterior end of the spore. The spores are uninuclear with a posterior vacuole.

Recently a microsporidium infection was discovered in Anopheles superpictus (Diptera: Culicidae) larvae, in Iran. The responsible agent belonged to the genus Parathelohania (Microsporidia: Amblyosporidae). This study has been carried out to identify its identity at the species level. Fresh infected larvae were collected from the type locality, Kiar district, in Chahar Mahal and Bakhtiari province, at the central western of Iran. Superficial and the internal ultrastructure of the recovered spores were explored by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. Molecular techniques were also employed to amplify parts of its ssu rDNA. The obtained data were compared with the available information of congener species and other closely related microsporidia to elucidate evolutionary relationship. A small apical depression and two posterolateral ridges extending backward from a pear shaped anterior body mass were notable under scanning electron microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy revealed 2 broad and 3–4 narrow coils in the either side of spores, respectively. The sequence of a 1062 nucleotide fragment of ssu rDNA was determined by means of PCR technique. This study indicates that the microsporidium infecting An. superpictus differs from other previously described species in the genus Parathelohania. It means that the microsporidium infecting An. superpictus is a new species and hereby it is called Parathelohania iranica.

The spores of Pe. moriokae had an average size of 1.0 × 3.8 µm and 1.3 × 3.2 µm in the intestine and hypodermis, respectively, and electron microscopy revealed that they exhibited distinguishing features with morphological diversity in the hypodermis. Isolated spores were able to infect a reference strain of O. tipulae (CEW1) through horizontal transmission but not the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Upon infection, the spores were first observed in the hypodermis and then in the intestine the following day, suggesting a unique infectious route among nematode-infective microsporidia.

(Microsporidia, Pleistophoridae) from Pagrus pagrus in Egypt ::: The spore morphology and molecular systematic of a new microsporidian which was isolated from the common sea bream Pagrus pagrus (F: Sparidae Linnaeus, 1758) from the Red Sea, Egypt have been studied. Fifty-six out of 300 (18.7 %) of this fish were infected with microsporidian parasites. The infection was appeared as whitish, ellipsoid, round, or elongated nodules embedded in the epithelial lining of the peritoneum and also in the intestinal epithelium. Light microscopic study revealed that nodules were encapsulated by a fibrous layer encircling numerous mature spores measuring 1.7 ± 0.6 (1.5–2.7 μm) × 1.5 ± 0.3 μm (1.2–1.8 μm) in size. Ultrastructure of spores was characteristic for the genus Pleistophora: dimorphic, uninucleate spores (each spore possesses three to five polar filament coils) and a posterior vacuole. Also, the early recognizable stages of the parasite within nodules include uninucleated, binucleated, and multinucleated meronts followed by detachment of the plasmalemma of the sporont producing sporoblasts which mature to spores that consist of a spore coat and spore contents. Also, we analyzed the small subunit ribosomal gene (SSUrDNA) using PCR and sequencing specimens from the marine populations of P. pagrus fish from the Red Sea. From blast searches, sequence analysis, and phylogenetic analysis, we did not find corresponding GenBank entries to our species. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences showed that the sequence of our microsporidium was most similar to five Pleistophora species with degrees of identity (>91.5 %). It was most similar (97.8 % identity) to that of Pleistophora hyphessobryconis (account no. GU126672) differing in 19 nucleotide positions and with lower divergence value, Pleistophora ovariae (96.2 % identity, account no.

This microsporidian forms whitish xenomas containing variable number of spores, reaching up to ~0.4 mm in diameter. The mature spores, pyriformin shape, with slightly round ends, measured 3.4 ± 0.5 μm long and 1.9 ± 0.3 μm wide (n = 50) and showed characteristics typical of Microsporidia. The average thickness of the spore wall was 100 (96–108) nm (n = 50), and the spore wall was composed of two layers, a thin, electron-dense exospore and a thick electron-transparent endospore. The exospore was surrounded by a thin, irregular layer of granular material. The anchoring disc was mushroom-like, located in the apical region of the spore in an eccentric position relative to the spore axis, rendering bilateral asymmetry to the spore. The anterior part of the polar filament (PF) (manubrium) measured approximately 125 (122–128) nm thick (n = 30), and the angle of tilt between the anterior PF and the spore axis was ~45°; the posterior part was packed in 8–9 coils. Phylogenetic analysis showed a strongly supported clade containing family Spragueidae Weissenberg, 1976, family Tetramicridae Matthews and Matthews, 1980, Microsporidium sp.

However, many of these pathogens are known only from molecular-based studies. We provide ultrastructural data supported by molecular phylogeny for a common microsporidium infecting the Daphnia longispina complex, important planktonic filter-feeders in reservoirs and ponds in the temperate Holarctic region. This parasite, previously characterized only by molecular means, infects adipose cells around the Daphnia midgut and eventually fills the centre of the host body with ovoid-shaped spores. A new microsporidian genus and species belonging to the Agglomeratidae superclade is described as Pseudoberwaldia daphniae gen. et sp. nov. Molecular data indicate its widespread presence in Central European reservoirs (reported as isolate “MIC1”) but also in Swedish coastal rockpools (“Ängskärs-klubben”). The most closely related lineage was reported from a caddisfly larva; we thus speculate that this taxon may have an insect secondary host in its life cycle.

The parasite elicits formation of spherical xenomas of up to 1.2 mm in diameter containing all observed life stages from early merogonal plasmodia to mature spores contained within the cytoplasm of host hepatocytes. Merogonal plasmodia existed in direct contact with the host cytoplasm and contained up to 20 visible nuclei. Plasmotomy of the multinucleate plasmodium led to formation of uninucleate cells in which the nucleus underwent further division to form bi-nucleate presporonts, sporonts (defined by cells with a thickened endospore) and eventually sporoblasts (containing pre-cursors of the spore extrusion apparatus). Mature spores were pyriform and monokaryotic, measuring 2.3 ± 0.19 μm long and 1.3 ± 0.10 μm wide. Spores possessed a bipartite polaroplast and 5–6 coils of a polar filament, in a single rank. The obtained partial SSU rRNA gene sequence, 1383 bp in length, did not match any of microsporidia available in GenBank. SSU rDNA-based phylogenetic analysis indicated a new taxon branching with Kabatana rondoni, a parasite infecting the skeletal muscle of Gymnorhamphichthys rondoni from the Amazon River. Due to different host and tissue tropism, the novel taxon did not fit the diagnostic criteria for the genus Kabatana.

The earliest stage observed was diplo- karyotic merozoites, which mature directly into diplokaryotic sporonts. The first division of the sporont is a meiosis, identified by the occurrence of synaptonemal complexes, and it is usually followed by a mitotical division, resulting in a plasmodium with 8 single nuclei. The cytoplasm is further divided into 8 lobes which finally give rise to 8 rounded sporoblasts. Each sporoblast matures into a barrel-shaped spore, with a spore-wall composed of three layers, 280 - 350 nm thick. Most spores are octosporous microspores, dimensions 2.0-3.1 X 2.0-2.7 um in fixed preparations, but a small number of macrospores, 3.5 -4.5 X 2.8 -3.0 um, are produced in pansporoblasts with four spores. Both spore types with a single nucleus and a nearly identical fine structure. The anehoring disc is small and the straight part of the polar filament reaches the posterior pole of the spore. It is surrounded by a polaroplast composed of two structurally different parts. The anterior part is about 1/3 of the spore length, the posterior about 2/3. The polar filament is of approximately uniform thickness all over its length. In microspores the diameter is 120 -140 nm, in macrospores it is slightly bigger, 125-150 nm. The polar filament of microspores is posteriorly arranged as 4-5 coils in a single layer close to the spore wall. The angle of tilt of the first fila- ment coil is approximately 45 degrees. In macrospores the posterior part of the filament is ar- ranged as 8 irregularly stacked coils. Sporogony occurs in a pansporoblast trans versed by a fibrous material continuous from the spore wall to the pansporoblast membrane, which has a hair-like fibrous appearance.

A new microsporidian Trachipleistophora extenrec n. sp. was isolated from a muscle lesion of the streaked tenrec Hemicentetes semispinosus Cuvier, 1798 (Mammalia, Tenrecidae), an insectivore endemic to Madagascar. The spores isolated from the tenrec were infectious to severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice by intramuscular injection. Material obtained from muscular lesions in mice was used for the parasite description. All developmental stages of the microsporidian were covered by a dense coat, which during sporogony changed into the sporophorous vesicle wall. Eight, 16, 32, or more spores were formed inside the sporophorous vesicle as the result of the division by plasmotomy and sequential fission of a multinucleate sporogonial plasmodium. Spores were ovoid, 4.7 × 2.8 μm in size, had a large posterior vacuole, and had an isofilar polar tube with 15–16 coils. Although the fine structure and the developmental pattern of the organism were in some respects similar to the genus Vavraia, molecular phylogeny based on the gene sequences of the small subunit rRNA and RNA polymerase subunit II indicated that the organism belongs to the genus Trachipleistophora. The diagnostic characters of the genera Trachipleistophora and Vavraia are discussed as well as the discrepancies between the phylogenies of these two microsporidian genera based on morphology and molecules.",Madagascar; Czech Republic,Madagascar (); Czech Republic (),Madagascar (); Tenrecidae (),1,1,1,TRUE

Merogonial stages and sporonts are diplokaryotic. Four merozoites with lobed protrusions are formed by rosette-like division. Sporonts develop into plasmodia with eight isolated nuclei. Sporoblasts are formed by rosette-like budding in a spherical, persistent sporophorous vesicle, generated by the sporont. No inclusions of the episporontal space are visible using light microscopy. Two kinds of projections are formed by the lobed sporogonial plasmodium: chains of globular components, which disappear when the sporoblasts are released, and arrays of persistent fibrillar material, which connect the sporblasts with the envelope of the sporophorous vesicle. Mature spores are oval, with pointed anterior pole, and with about five fibrous posterior projections, which are visible with difficulty using light microscopy, but distinct in electron microscopy. Unfixed spores measure 4.2–4.6 × 6.3–7.0 µm. The spore wall has distinct endo- and exospore layers. The exospore is three-layered, with a lucent surface layer, a median double-layer and an internal granular layer of variable thickness. The polaroplast has two parts: closely arranged lamellae anteriorly, sac-like chambers posteriorly. The polar filament is anisofilar with 3–4, 238–316 nm wide anterior coils and 4–5, 192–209 nm wide posterior coils in a single row close to the spore wall in the posterior half of the spore.

All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. In the merogonial reproduction multinucleate plasmodia divide by plasmotomy, yielding uninucleate merozoites. Sporonts develop into multinucleate plasmodia, which split in a rosette-like manner, initially into wide lobes with large nuclei, finally into narrow lobes with small nuclei. Sporoblasts are formed in individual sporophorous vesicles generated by the sporogonial plasmodium. Immature sporogonial stages are covered by fibrillar projections uniting the exospore with the envelope of the sporophorous vesicle. Mature spores, which are pyriform with pointed anterior end, normally lack projections. Unfixed spores measure 4.6-5.7x2.7-3.3 urn. The exospore is four-layered. The anterior lamellae of the polaroplast are wide. The posterior ones (present in a short zone) are narrow close to the filament, wider at the periphery. The polar filament is isofilar with 9-10, 102-131 nm wide, coils in a single layer close to the spore wall in posterior half of the spore. The angle of tilt is 60-65°. Isometric, 21-25 nm wide virus-like particles were observed in the nuclei of mature spores. Experimental transmission of the microsporidium per os has failed.

An octosporous microsporidian, present at all three sites, was found in both years infecting from 7 to 22% of larvae. Spores (stained in Giemsa) measured 3.0 microns +/- 0.25 microns x 2.25 microns +/- 0.26 microns. Ultrastructurally, spores were seen to have an anterior rim surrounding a depressed area where the endospore was at its thinnest. In transmission electron microscopy section, the rim appeared as two processes into which all layers of the wall extended. At the posterior end all layers of the wall extended into a simple knob-like structure which could be interpreted as a section through a crest running longitudinally around the spore. The polar filament was anisofilar, with two anterior coils of greater diameter than the three posterior coils.

Abstract A new microsporidium was isolated from the endemic, Taiwanese shrimp, Caridina formosae (Decapoda, Atyidae) from northern Taiwan. A conspicuous symptom of infection was presence of opaque white xenomas located in the proximity of the alimentary tract, the surface of the hepatopancreas, and the gills. A fully developed xenoma consisted of a hard, thick capsule filled with sporophorous vesicles containing multiple spores. Microsporidia developed synchronously within the same sporophorous vesicle, although the stage of parasite development differed among the vesicles. Fresh spores were pyriform, mononucleated and measured 6.53×4.38μm. The polar filament was anisofilar with 9–11 coils. Phylogenetic analysis based on the small subunit ribosomal DNA sequence showed that the isolate is most similar to the fish microsporidian clade containing the genera Kabatana, Microgemma, Potaspora, Spraguea, and Teramicra. The highest sequence identity, 80%, was with Spraguea spp. Based on pathogenesis, life cycle and phylogenetic analysis, we erect a new genus and species, Triwangia caridinae for the novel microsporidium.",Taiwan,Taiwan (),Taiwan (); Caridina (); Potaspora (); Triwangia (),1,3,0,TRUE

Its description, based on one of the first ultrastructural studies of microsporidia from orthopteran hosts, lacked information on the details of cell surface structure, which are considered to be very important in modern taxonomy. We have re-investigated the material upon which the original description of N. maroccanus was based and revealed new ultrastructural characters of its cell surface. Late meronts are surrounded with microtubuli, about 20 nm in diameter, attached to the membrane, later replaced with electron dense granules, forming a typical coating of the sporont's surface (the primordium of exospore). Mature spores are also surrounded with a layer of microtubuli. Host cell cytoplasm contains small vesicles with electron-dense cores, up to 50 nm in diameter, surrounding late meronts, sporogonial stages and spores of the parasite. Polar tube is slightly anisofilar. These characters disagree with the diagnosis of Nosema, but fit that of the recently established genus Tubulinosema. Hence, we transferred the species studied into this genus, establishing Tubulinosema maroccanus comb. nov. Analysis of cell surface ultrastructure of two Tubulinosema species from Orthoptera showed that they shared two characters not mentioned in the diagnosis of the genus. Therefore, the diagnosis of Tubulinosema was modified to include two more characters: presence of vesicles with electron-dense cores surrounding sporogonial stages and presence of microtubuli not only in late meronts, but also, in some species, in spores.",Uzbekistan,Uzbekistan (),Uzbekistan (Uzbekistan); Orthoptera (); Nurzhanov (),1,3,0,TRUE

The new isolate was highly pathogenic to S. litura larvae. Host specificity tests performed on 37 non-target hosts of 5 different insect orders revealed that the new isolate is pathogenic only to lepidopteran insects. We sequenced the 16S small subunit rRNA (SSU rRNA) gene of the isolate and compared it with 72 non-redundant microsporidian sequences from the GenBank. Based on the light microscopic studies and phylogenetic analyses, the new isolate is assigned to the genus Nosema. Significant differences in the SSU rRNA sequence were identified when compared with the type species Nosema bombycis and other closely related species viz., Nosema spodopterae. Structural differences were also observed in the 16S SSU rRNA between the new isolate and the two above-mentioned microsporidian pathogens. We conclude that the microsporidian isolate reported here is distinctly different from the other known species and is likely to be a new species.",India,India (),India (Tamil Nadu); Serbia (India),1,3,0,TRUE
672,Unnamed Vairimorpha sp.,"First detection of a microsporidium in the crucifer pest Hellula undalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae)—a possible control agent? ::: For the first time, a microsporidian infection was observed in the pest species Hellula undalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) in crucifer fields in Nueva–Ecija, Philippines. Because H. undalis is difficult to control by chemical insecticides and microbiological control techniques have not been established, we investigated the biology, the pathogenicity and transmission of this pathogen found in H. undalis. An average of 16% of larvae obtained from crucifer fields in Nueva–Ecija displayed microsporidian infections and 75% of infected H. undalis died during larval development. Histopathological studies revealed that the infection is initiated in the midgut and then spreads to all organs. The microsporidium has two different sporulation sequences: a disporoblastic development producing binucleate free mature spores and an octosporoblastic development forming eight uninucleate spores. These two discrete life cycles imply its taxonomic assignment to the genus Vairimorpha. The size of the binucleate, diplokaryotic spores as measured on Giemsa-stained smears was 3.56±0.29μm in length and 2.18±0.21μm in width, whereas the uninucleate octospores measured 2.44±0.20×1.64±0.14μm. The microsporidium was orally and probably also transovarially transmitted. Laboratory infection tests by feeding spores on artificial diet to 3rd instars resulted in 100% infection with a final mortality of 80%. Most larvae died during larval development and 40% of them died 3 days after spore ingestion.

(Microsporidia: Burenellidae) and Thelohania contejeani (Microsporidia: Thelohaniidae), two parasites of the white-clawed crayfish, Austropotamobius pallipes complex (Decapoda: Astacidae) ::: The microsporidiosis of the endangered white-clawed crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes complex has generally been attributed to only one species, Thelohania contejeani, the agent of porcelain disease. Species identification was mostly assessed by macroscopic examination or microscopic evaluation of muscle samples rather than by molecular or ultrastructural analyses. A survey conducted on A. pallipes complex populations in Northern Italy highlighted the presence of two different microsporidia causing similar muscular lesions, T. contejeani and an undescribed octosporoblastic species Vairimorpha austropotamobii sp. nov. Mature spores and earlier developmental stages of V. austropotamobii sp. nov. were found within striated muscle cells of the thorax, abdomen, and appendages of the crayfish. Only octosporoblastic sporogony within sporophorous vesicles (SPVs) was observed. Diplokaryotic sporonts separated into two uninucleate daughter cells, which gave rise to a rosette-shaped plasmodium, and eight uninucleate spores were produced within the persistent SPV. Ultrastructural features of stages in the octosporoblastic sequence were similar to those described for Vairimorpha necatrix, the type species. Mature spores were pyriform in shape and an average of 3.9 × 2.2 µm in size. The polar filament was coiled 11–14 times, lateral to the posterior vacuole. The small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rRNA) and the large subunit RNA polymerase II gene (RPB1) of V. austropotamobii sp. nov. were sequenced and compared with other microsporidia.

Vairimorpha cheracis sp. nov. was found in a highland population of the Australian freshwater crayfish, Cherax destructor. The majority of spores and earlier developmental stages of V. cheracis sp. nov. were found within striated muscle cells of the thorax, abdomen, and appendages of the crayfish. Only octosporoblastic sporogony within sporophorous vesicles (SPVs) was observed. Diplokaryotic sporonts separated into two uninucleate daughter cells, each of which gave rise to four sporoblasts in a rosette-shaped plasmodium, so that eight uninucleate spores were produced within the persistent ovoid SPV. Ultrastructural features of stages in the octosporoblastic sequence were similar to those described for Vairimorpha necatrix, the type species. Mature spores were pyriform in shape and averaged 3.4×1.9μm in dimensions. The anterior polaroplast was lamellar in structure, and the posterior polaroplast vesicular. The polar filament was coiled 10–12 times, lateral to the posterior vacuole. The small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) of V. cheracis sp. nov. was sequenced and compared with other microsporidia. V. cheracis sp. nov. showed over 97% sequence identity with Vairimorpha imperfecta and five species of Nosema, and only 86% sequence identity with V. necatrix.

Abstract Vairimorpha sp. BM (2012) is a recent isolate of the microsporidia from the silkworm in Shandong, China. The ultrastructure, tissue pathology and molecular characterization of this isolate is described in this study. This pathogenic fungus causes pebrine disease in silkworms which manifests as a systemic infection. Meanwhile, the silkworm eggs produced by the infected moths were examined using a microscope and PCR amplification. Neither spores nor the expected PCR band were observed, suggesting that no vertical transmission occurred in Bombyx mori. In addition, the ultrastructure of the isolate was studied by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Two types of spores were observed: diplokaroytic spores with 13–17 coils of polar tubes and monokaryotic spores with less coils of polar tubes which could form octospores; however, no sporophorous vesicles were observed. Finally, phylogenetic analysis of the small subunit rRNA genes of Vairimorpha species showed that this isolate has a closer relationship to Vairimorpha necatrix than the other species studied. This result also is supported by phylogenetic analysis based on their actin genes, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and RNA polymerase II (RPB1). Based on the information gained during this study, we propose that this microsporidian species infecting B. mori should be given the name V. necatrix BM.",(Shandong) China,China (Shandong),China (Shandong); Bombyx mori (),2,1,0,TRUE

The microsporidium produces systemic infections in O. lida larvae; the midgut epithelium, Malpighian tubules, and midgut muscle tissues were the target tissues for this isolate, and atrophied fat body tissues were found in heavily infected larvae. Two types of spores were observed, diplokaroytic spores with 11–13 coils of polar tube, and monokaryotic spores with 12 coils of the polar tube that developed within a sporophorous vesicle to form octospores. Electron-dense granules were abundant in the episporontal space of the sporophorous vesicles, and were similar to those of Vairimorpha invictae isolated from Solenopsis invicta, but different from granules or inclusions of other Vairimorpha species. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the small subunit ribosomal DNA sequence, this isolate is unique within the Vairimorpha complex.

The disease was responsible for the disruption of both the eggs and the biomass production. The main microsporidian is primarily a muscular parasite, with pansporoblastic development. All stages presented isolated nuclei. In merogonial stages, the amorphous coat divided with the cell, whereas in the sporogonial plasmodia the protoplasm retracted away from the coat, producing the vesicule cavity. Sporogonial division occurred both stepwise and by rosette-shape fragmentation. The number of nuclei in mature sporonts was variable and sometimes exceeded 64. As the sporophorous vesicle became mature, the matrix was occupied by metabolic granular products that became tubular. Microspores (3.3 × 2.1 μm) and macrospores (4.1 × 2.7 μm) were observed. The number of coils of the anisofilar filament was 11 (microspores) and 15 (macrospores).

A diplokaryotic microsporidian was found infecting all nematogens from all the samples taken in both years. The infected cells contained all developmental stages. Merogony initially was monokaryotic and sporogony of diplokaryotic sporonts was by multiple fission. The stained ovoidal spores measured between 4.3-6 μm x 1.7-2.3 μm. The ultrastructural findings come from 11 specimens of Kantharella antarctica that were cut in serial sections. All developmental stages were noteworthy because of the myelinosomes situated adjacent to each diplokaryon. Similarly conspicuous were some organelles in the spore: a prominent, extraordinarily electron dense anterior portion of the polaroplast and the posterior vacuole. The isofilar polar filament with a diameter of about i 15 nm showed 9-11 coils. The great number of empty spore cases together with an extruded polar filament are indicative of an autoinfection. Though these characteristics resemble in part those of the genus Nosema from the family Nosematidae, the species in Kantharella antarctica differs from the former by its unusual development, life cycle and unusual host.
