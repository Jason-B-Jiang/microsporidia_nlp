6,Agglomerata lacrima,1,"Ultrastructure and light microscopic cytology of Agglomerata lacrima n. sp. (Microspora, Duboscqiidae), a microsporidian parasite of Acanthocyclops vernalis (Copepoda, Cyclopidae) ::: Agglomerata lacrima n. sp. is the first species of the genus described from a copepod host (Acanthocyclops vernalis.) It was studied using light- and electron-microscopy. All stages of the life-cycle had isolated nuclei. The earliest stages found were uninucleate merozoites. Sporogony produced 4-12 (mostly 8) pyriform spores by rosette-like budding within a fragile sporophorous vesicle. Live spores measured 4.4 +/- 0.2 x 2.6 +/- 0.2 μm, and fixed spores measured 3.7 +/- 0.2 x 1.6 +/- 0.2 μm. The exospore was constructed of 4 layers. The anisofilar polar filament made 5-6 coils in the posterior half of the spore. The polaroplast had an anterior part with wide lamellae (chambers), followed by a second zone of narrow lamellae. Tubule-like structures which might constitute a third polaroplast region were present immediately anterior to the first filament coil. Cytological characteristics and the generic position of the species are discussed, and it is compared to related or resembling species, and to all previously reported microsporidian species from copepods.",hypodermal; adipose,hypodermal; adipose,hypodermal; adipose,merozoites,0,1,2

(Microsporea:Glugeidae), a microsporidian of Bufo marinus tadpoles and metamorphosing toads (Amphibia:Anura) from Amazonian Brazil ::: A microsporidian infection, due to Alloglugea bufonis nov. gen., nov. sp., is described in the tadpoles and newly metamorphosed toads of Bufo marinus from a lake near Belem, Para, north Brazil. Xenomas occur either singly in the lamina propria of the intestine, or aggregated into cystic bodies of up to 0.2 mm diameter, which emerge above the intestine surface. The xenoma is bounded by a folded plasmalemma with pinocytotic depressions, and there is a central, enlarged nucleus. Plasmodial stages and elongate meronts differentiate ~ n t o ribbon-shaped sporonts and single-nucleated sporo- blasts. The spore cytoplasm is invaginated at the posterior end. Spores escape from the mature xeno- mas into reticuloendothelial cells of the liver, spleen and kidneys of the tadpoles and newly metamorphosed toads, but infection is gradually lost after metamorphosis.","intestines (lamina propria); liver (reticuloendothelial cells, blood vessels); spleen (primary infection site); kidney (glomeruli, primary infection site); macrophages; phagocytes",intestines; lamina propria; liver; reticuloendothelial cells; blood vessels; spleen; kidney; glomeruli; macrophages; phagocytes,blood vessels; kidney; phagocytes; lamina propria; reticuloendothelial cells; liver; macrophages; glomeruli; intestines; spleen,tadpoles,0,1,10
13,Amazonspora hassar,1,"Amazonspora hassar n. gen. and n. sp. (Phylum Microsporidia, fam. Glugeidae), a parasite of the Amazonian teleost Hassar orestis (fam. Doradidae) ::: We describe the microsporidian Amazonspora hassar n. gen., n. sp. from the gill xenomas of the teleost Hassar orestis (Doradidae) collected in the estuarine region of the Amazon River. The parasite appeared as a small whitish xenoma located in the gill filaments near the blood vessels. Each xenoma consisted of a single hypertrophic host cell (HHC) in the cytoplasm of which the microsporidian developed and proliferated. The xenoma wall was composed of up to approximately 22 juxtaposed crossed layers of collagen fibers. The plasmalemma of the HHC presented numerous anastomosed, microvilli-like structures projecting outward through the 1-3 first internal layers of the collagen fibrils. The parasite was in direct contact with host cell cytoplasm in all stages of the cycle (merogony and sporogony). Sporogony appears to divide by plasmotomy, giving rise to 4 uninucleate sporoblasts, which develop into uninucleate spores. The ellipsoidal spores measured 2.69 ± 0.45 × 1.78 ± 0.18 μm, and the wall measured ∼75 nm. The anchoring disk of the polar filament was subterminal, being shifted laterally from the anterior pole. The polar filament was arranged into 7-8 coils in a single layer in the posterior half of the spore, surrounding the posterior vacuole. The polaroplast surrounded the uncoiled portion of the polar filament, and it was exclusively lamellar. The spores and different life-cycle stages were intermingled within the cytoplasm of the HHC, surrounding the central hypertrophic deeply branched nucleus. The ultrastructural morphology of this microsporidian parasite suggests the erection of a new genus and species.",gills,gills,gills,blood vessels; gill xenomas; gill filaments,0,3,1

(Microsporidia: Amblyosporidae) in the mosquito Culex renatoi (Diptera, Culicidae) and the copepod Paracyclops fimbriatus fimbriatus (Copepoda, Cyclopidae) ::: The life cycle of Amblyospora camposi n. sp. is described from the mosquito Culex renatoi and the copepod Paracyclops fimbriatus fimbriatus collected in the leaf axils of the plant Eryngium cabrerae in Argentina. Meiospores of A. camposi (5.8 x 4.1 μm) were infectious per os to female adults of the copepod P. f. fimbriatus. All developmental stages in the copepod had unpaired nuclei, with sporulation involving the formation of a sub-persistent, sporontogenic, interfacial envelope and the production of a second type of uninucleate spore. These spores, formed in the ovaries of P. f. fimbriatus, were large, pyriform, and measured 10.70 x 3.85 μm. When ingested they infected C. renatoi larvae to initiate a sequence that involves schizogony and gametogony and ends with plasmogamy and nuclear association to form diplokaryotic meronts. Oblong ovate binucleate spores (7.86 x 2.96 μm) are formed in the adult mosquito and are responsible for vertical transmission to the filial generation.

The parasite is transovarially transmitted for one generation only. Spores in adult females extrude binucleate sporoplasms which infect developing eggs. Merogony occurs in larval oenocytes with diplokaryotic stages in early instars giving rise to plasmodia with many diplokarya. Plasmodia undergo cytokinesis to form diplokaryotic sporonts. In fat body cells, these sporonts secrete pansporoblastic membranes and undergo two nuclear divisions to form octonucleate sporonts. Cytokinesis and differentiation result in uninucleate spores in packets of eight. These spores are not transmissible per os and are of different morphotype from those in adult females.

(Microspora, Amblyosporidae) a microsporidian of the blackfly Eusimulium costatum (Diptera, Simuliidae) ::: An Amblyospora species (microspora, Abblyosporidae) collected in the southeast region of Austria was examined using light and electron microscopic methods. The hosts were larvae of Eusimulium costatum (Diptera, Simuliidae). The merogonial stages were found to be diplocaryotic. During sporogony, eight monocaryotic spores developed in a sporophorous vesicle. The truncate spores measured between 2.9×2.3 and 4.1×3.2 μm and had an anisofilar polar tube, the narrow part of which was rather short. Besides tubules and homogeneous, electron-dense inclusions, unique filamentous structures were observed in the episporontal space.

78,Amblyospora trinus,1,"Amblyospora trinus N. Sp. (Microsporida: Amblyosporidae) in the Australian Mosquito Culex halifaxi (Diptera: Culicidae) ::: A new species of Amblyospora, a parasite found in wild populations of the predacious Australian mosquito Culex halifaxi, was investigated with light and electron microscopy. This species was found to be heterosporous with two concurrent sporulation sequences in the host larvae, both arising from diplokaryotic meronts and ending with haploid spores. One sequence was dominant and involved meiosis to produce eight thick‐walled, broadly oval meiospores in a sporophorous vesicle (SV). The other sequence involved nuclear dissociation to produce lanceolate, thin‐walled spores in a subpersistent SV. Horizontal transmission to the mosquito host, by one or both of two distinctly different pathways (one via an intermediate host, the other by cannibalism of infected individuals) and by vertical transmission, are postulated but have not been demonstrated.

84,Ameson herrnkindi,1,"Characterization of microsporidian Ameson herrnkindi sp. nov. infecting Caribbean spiny lobsters Panulirus argus ::: The Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus supports a large and valuable fishery in the Caribbean Sea. In 2007-2008, a rare microsporidian parasite with spore characteristics typical of the Ameson genus was detected in 2 spiny lobsters from southeast Florida (FL). However, the parasite species was not confirmed by molecular analyses. To address this deficiency, reported here are structural and molecular data on single lobsters displaying comparable ‘cotton-like’ abdominal muscle containing ovoid microsporidian spores found at different locations in FL in 2014 and 2018 and in Saint Kitts and Nevis Islands in 2017. In the lobster from 2014, multiple life stages consistent with an Ameson-like monokaryotic microsporidian were detected by transmission electron microscopy. A partial (1228 bp) small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene sequence showed each microsporidia to be identical and positioned it closest phylogenetically to Ameson pulvis in a highly supported clade also containing A. michaelis, A. metacarcini, A. portunus, and Nadelspora canceri.

85,Ameson metacarcini,1,"Ameson metacarcini sp. nov. (Microsporidia) infecting the muscles of Dungeness crabs Metacarcinus magister from British Columbia, Canada ::: The Dungeness crab Metacarcinus magister supports a large and valuable fishery along the west coast of North America. Since 1998, Dungeness crabs exhibiting pink- to orange-colored joints and opaque white musculature have been sporadically observed in low prevalence from the Fraser River delta of British Columbia, Canada. We provide histological, ultrastructural, and molecular evidence that this condition is caused by a new microsporidian parasite. Crabs displaying gross symptoms were confirmed to have heavy infections of ovoid-shaped microsporidian spores (~1.8 × 1.4 µm in size) within muscle bundles of the skeletal musculature. The parasite apparently infected the outer periphery of each muscle bundle, and then proliferated into the muscle fibres near the centre of each infected bundle. Light infections were observed in heart tissues, and occasionally spores were observed within the fixed phagocytes lining the blood vessels of the hepatopancreas. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed multiple life stages of a monokaryotic microsporidian parasite within the sarcoplasm of muscle fibres. Molecular analysis of partial small subunit rRNA sequence data from the new species revealed an affinity to Ameson, a genus of Microsporidia infecting marine crustaceans. Based on morphological and molecular data, the new species is distinct from Nadelspora canceri, a related microsporidian that also infects the muscles of this host.

Sporogony and spore ultrastructure of this microsporidium differed from that of known microsporidian species, suggesting establishment of a new species, Anisofilariata chironomi, being a type species of a new genus. Sporogony di-, tetra-, octo-, and 16-sporoblastic. Fixed and stained spores are 4.7-6.8 x 3.4-5.4 microm in size, the spore measurements varying depending upon the number of spores in the sporophorous vesicle. The polaroplast is bipartite, with anterior and posterior parts composed of very thin and thick lamellae, respectively, and occupies the major volume of the spore. The polar filament is anisofilar, with two broad proximal and 10-13 narrow distal coils arranged in 2-4 layers. The sporophorous vesicle is bounded by a thin membrane and contains multiple tubular structures. Small subunit ribosomal DNA phylogeny showed basal position of the new microsporidium to a cluster uniting microsporidia infecting ciliates (Euplotespora binucleata), microcrustaceans (Glugoides intestinalis, Mrazekia macrocyclopis), lepidopteran insects (Cystosporogenes spp., Endoreticulatus spp.) and human (Vittaforma corneae), nested within Clade IV sensu Vossbrinck and Debrunner-Vossbrinck (2005 Folia Parasitol 52:131-142).

Diagnosis was originally based on light microscopy, and was confirmed by PCR amplification and electron microscopy. This is the first record of microsporidia infection in the insect order Psocoptera. Four morphological spore types corresponded to four original SSUrDNA sequences (Genbank accession no. FJ865221-24), suggesting infection with four microsporidia species. Two of those species were examined by electron microscopy. We describe here one new genus and two new species based on morphological and sequence data: Antonospora psocopterae sp. n. with elongated diplokaryotic spores, 4.4±0.05×1.9±0.03μm and Mockfordia xanthocaeciliae gen. n. sp. n. with ovocylindrical monokaryotic spores, 2.5±0.10×1.4±0.02μm. A. psocopterae displayed high sequence (95%) and structural similarity with Antonospora scoticae, fell within a well supported dichotomy with A. scoticae inside the Antonospora–Paranosema clade in phylogenetic analyses by NJ, PS and ML. M. xanthocaeciliae did not exhibit much sequence or structural similarity with any of known microsporidia species, except Encephalitozoon spp. M. xanthocaeciliae fell within one clade with Encephalitozoon spp. in phylogenies and shared with encephalitozoons structural resemblance and about 80% of SSUrDNA sequence identity. The other two species were not described and provisionally were placed to the collective genus Microsporidium as Microsporidium sp. 1 and Microsporidium sp. 4 from bark lice because of insufficient morphological data. The finding that samples fixed and stored for months in propylene glycol (“antifreeze”) are good enough for DNA sequence analysis and can be used for morphological analyses (if no better fixation alternatives are available), is promising for future surveys for microsporidia.",Adipose,Adipose,Adipose,Microsporidium sp. 4; Xanthocaecilius; bark; Microsporidium sp. 1,0,4,1

(Protozoa, microsporidia) a parasite of the communal bee, Andrena scotica Perkins, 1916 (Hymenoptera, andrenidae) ::: The new microsporidium Antonospora scoticae n. gen., n. sp., a parasite of the communal bee Andrena scotica, is described based on light microscopy, ultrastructural characteristics and the nucleotide sequence of the small subunit ribosomal RNA coding region. The parasite is apansporoblastic and develops in close contact with the host cytoplasm. All developmental stages are diplokaryotic. Cytoplasmic fission was not observed, but the sporogony is believed to be disporoblastic. Live spores are ovocylindrical, straight to slightly curved, and measure 6.8 x 2.7 μm whereas spores fixed and stained for TEM measure 5.0 x 1.8 υm. The exospore is four-layered, with an internal single layer followed by a thicker, more electron dense layer, then another single layer followed by a thin external double layer. The polar filament is isofilar and arranged in 15-22 coils in the posterior and mid-part of the spore. The polaroplast has tightly packed lamellae that become less densely packed in the posterior region. The coding region of the small subunit ribosomal RNA is 1371 base pairs long. Its GC content (62%) is significantly higher than previously reported for this group of organisms. The systematic position of the described microsporidium was found to be ambiguous and is discussed in the context of inconsistencies between the molecular and morphological taxonomy of microsporidia. A new genus is proposed for A. scoticae without defining superior taxa because the current developmental and morphological evidence is limited and partly contradictory to the molecular data. Current taxonomies of microsporidia are based on characters that are most likely polyphyletic in nature. Traditional systems of microsporidian taxonomy may need to be extensively revised, as molecular data become available.",adipose tissue (in gaster); haemolymph; haemocoel,adipose tissue; haemolymph; haemocoel,haemocoel; adipose tissue; haemolymph,ribosomal,0,1,3

(Fungi: Microsporidia), a Parasite of Daphnia magna Straus, 1820 (Crustacea: Branchiopoda) ::: ABSTRACT . We describe a new microsporidian species Binucleata daphniae, n. g., n. sp., that infects the integument cells lining the hemocoele cavity of the carapace and the postabdomen of the cladoceran Daphnia magna Straus. Infected cells filled with spores accumulate as large clusters in the carapace cavity and heavily infected hosts are detected by their opaque appearance. Despite the parasite's presence, infected Daphnia grow and molt, but have a reduced fecundity. During the parasite's life cycle, chain-like meronts with isolated nuclei are formed, giving rise to binucleate presporonts, the most frequently observed, characteristic developmental stage. In sporogony, the nuclei of the presporont separate, divide, and eight spores enclosed in a thin-walled sporophorous vesicle are formed. Spores are 4.9 × 2.5 μm in size (fresh) and have an anisofilar polar filament with eight coils. DNA sequence analysis places B. daphniae in a clade of microsporidians that parasitize crustaceans and mosquitoes and have assumed complex life cycles. Binucleata daphniae, however, has a simple and direct life cycle and can be transferred to naïve hosts and maintained as persistent infections in populations of its host D. magna. We propose that B. daphniae has simplified its life cycle by losing its secondary host, rendering it unique in this clade.",integumentary,integumentary,integumentary,carapace; cladoceran Daphnia; integument cells; DNA,0,4,1

No other tissue types were infected. All parasite stages contain diplokaryotic nuclei and all cell division is by binary fission. Sporogony is disporoblastic, producing 2.9 x 2 microns diplokaryotic spores containing 8-10 coils of the polar filament arranged in one to three rows, usually two. Additionally, this microsporidium produces electron-dense extracellular secretions and vesiculotubular appendages similar to Nosema algerae. However, the production of protoplasmic extensions which may branch and terminate in extensive vesiculotubular structures is unique to this parasite. Additionally, unlike Nosema algerae, its development occurred at warm blooded host temperature (37-38 degrees C) and unlike Nosema connori, which disseminates to all tissue types, B. vesicularum infected only muscle cells. Thus, a new genus and species is proposed. Because of the similarities with the genus Nosema, this new genus is placed in the family Nosematidae. Successful clearing of this infection (both clinically and histologically) resulted from treatment with albendazole and itraconozole.",striated muscles,striated muscles,striated muscles,tissue; muscle cells,0,2,1
114,Burenella dimorpha,1,"New Family, Genus, and Species of Microsporida (Protozoa: Microsporida) from the Tropical Fire Ant, Solenopsis geminata (Fabricius) (Insecta: Formicidae)* ::: A new species of Microsporida, Burenella dimorpha sp. n., representing a new family, Burenellidae fam. n. and genus, is described on the basis of light‐ and electron‐microscope observations. The family is characterized by 2 sequences of sporogony, each sequence having morphologically different sporonts and spores. The parasite infects the tropical fire ant, Solenopsis geminata (Fabricius), producing distinct pathologic manifestations (clearing of the cuticle and eye malformation) and death in the pupal stage of development.

115,Cambaraspora floridanus,1,"A new lineage of crayfish-infecting Microsporidia: The Cambaraspora floridanus n. gen. n. sp. (Glugeida: Glugeidae) complex from Floridian freshwaters (USA) ::: Crayfish are a vital ecological asset in their native range but can be highly damaging as invasive species. Knowledge of their diseases, including high levels of research on Aphanomyces astaci (crayfish plague), show that disease plays a vital role during crayfish invasions. Microsporidian diseases in crayfish are less studied but are thought to have important links to crayfish health and invasion dynamics. In this study we provide a systematic description of a novel microsporidian parasite from the Floridian crayfish, Procambarus paeninsulanus, with additional genetic identification from related Microsporidia from Procambarus fallax, Cambarellus shufeldtii and Cambarellus blacki. This novel microsporidium from P. paeninsulanus is described in a new genus, Cambaraspora, and species, Cambaraspora floridanus, and represents a novel member of the Clade V Microsporidia within the Glugeidae. The parasite develops in the muscle tissue of P. paeninsulanus, within a sporophorous vesicle, and produces a spore with 19-21 turns of the polar filament measuring 6.136 ± 0.84 µm in length and 2.12 ± 0.23 µm in width. The muscle-infecting nature of the parasite suggests that it is horizontally transmitted. Genetic data for the 18S of the parasite from all hosts confirms its assignment to Clade V and reveal it to be a relative of multiple fish-infecting parasites. It shows closest genetic relationship to Glugea plecoglossi, but branches alongside multiple microsporidia from fish, crustaceans and eDNA isolates. The information presented here suggests that this novel parasite may have the potential to infect piscine hosts and is a likely mortality driver in the P. paeninsulanus population. Its potential as a control agent or wildlife disease invasion threat is explored, as well as the placement of this novel microsporidium within the Glugeidae.",muscle,muscle,muscle,paeninsulanus,0,1,1

131,Cucumispora roeselii,1,"Parasites, Pathogens and Commensals in the ‘Low-Impact’ Non-Native Amphipod Host Gammarus Roeselii ::: BACKGROUND: Whilst vastly understudied, pathogens of non-native species (NNS) are increasingly recognised as important threats to native wildlife. This study builds upon recent recommendations for improved screening for pathogens in NNS by focusing on populations of Gammarus roeselii in Chojna, north-western Poland. At this location, and in other parts of continental Europe, G. roeselii is considered a well-established and relatively 'low-impact' invader, with little understanding about its underlying pathogen profile and even less on potential spill-over of these pathogens to native species. RESULTS: Using a combination of histological, ultrastructural and phylogenetic approaches, we define a pathogen profile for non-native populations of G. roeselii in Poland. This profile comprised acanthocephalans (Polymorphus minutus Goese, 1782 and Pomphorhynchus sp.), digenean trematodes, commensal rotifers, commensal and parasitic ciliated protists, gregarines, microsporidia, a putative rickettsia-like organism, filamentous bacteria and two viral pathogens, the majority of which are previously unknown to science. To demonstrate potential for such pathogenic risks to be characterised from a taxonomic perspective, one of the pathogens, a novel microsporidian, is described based upon its pathology, developmental cycle and SSU rRNA gene phylogeny. The novel microsporidian Cucumispora roeselii n. sp. displayed closest morphological and phylogenetic similarity to two previously described taxa, Cucumispora dikerogammari (Ovcharenko & Kurandina, 1987), and Cucumispora ornata Bojko, Dunn, Stebbing, Ross, Kerr & Stentiford, 2015. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to our discovery extending the host range for the genus Cucumispora Ovcharenko, Bacela, Wilkinson, Ironside, Rigaud & Wattier, 2010 outside of the amphipod host genus Dikerogammarus Stebbing, we reveal significant potential for the co-transfer of (previously unknown) pathogens alongside this host when invading novel locations. This study highlights the importance of pre-invasion screening of low-impact NNS and, provides a means to document and potentially mitigate the additional risks posed by previously unknown pathogens.",muscle,muscle,muscle,SSU,0,1,1

The parasite grew prolifically and all developmental stages were observed. Meronts underwent binary fission and the daughter cells transformed into clongate, chain-like sporonts that eventually separated into sporoblasts. The formation of components of the mature spores is described. The parasite, a species of Encephalitozoon, underwent development both in the cytoplasm and within a parasitophorous vacuole, distinguishing it from the morphologically similar species E. cuniculi and E. hellem, both of which have been described from lesions in the human eye and have been reported to develop exclusively within a parasitophorous vacuole.",eye cornea,eye cornea,eye cornea,parasitophorous,0,1,1

All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. The merogonial reproduction was revealed by small groups of merozoites. The dominant sporogony yields four sporoblasts by rosette-like budding, enclosed in a sporophorous vesicle produced by the sporont. Together with the tetrasporous sporogony production of macrospores in 3-, 2- or 1-sporous vesicles occurs. Spores are pyriform, with pointed anterior pole. Fixed tetraspores from A. nervosa measure 3.0-3.5 x 4.6-5.2 mu m. The greatest fixed macrospores observed were 10.4 mu m long. The spore wall has the normal three subdivisions, including a layered, ca 43 nm wide exospore, where the intermediate layer is a double-layer The polaroplast has two lamellar parts, with the anterior lamellae more closely packed. The polar filament is isofilar, with 20-25 coils in tetraspores, up to 34 coils in macrospores. The coils have approximately identical diameter in tetraspores and macrospores. Granular and tubular inclusions of two kinds appear in the episporontal space. Wide, septate tubules of exospore nature disappear when the spores mature. Narrow, thin-walled tubules persist. Macrospores often exhibit aberrant cytology. In A. nervosa the adipose tissue is more or less completely invaded by the parasite. The fat body lobes are not transformed into syncytia. Defense reactions were not observed in this host. Infection in M. lateralis was visible as local herds, and nodule formation with incorporation of dark pigment was observed. The species is compared to previously described microsporidia of caddis flies and the generic position is discussed. It is obviously identical to the microsporidium Mackinnon (1911) reported under the name Gurleya legeri Hesse, 1903.",found in a liver lesion caused by Echinococcus multilocularis,found in a liver lesion caused by Echinococcus multilocularis,liver,adipose tissue; episporontal,0,2,1

A second species is now described that was associated with intestinal symptoms in a 32-year-old, human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive, Native American male homosexual. Stool studies and routine light microscopy of multiple small intestinal biopsies that showed atrophy with acute and chronic inilammation were without apparent patho- gens. Light microscopy of semi-thin plastic sections, cytochemical stains of paraffin sections, and ultrastructural studies revealed extensive microsporidial infection of enterocytes and submucosal macrophages. No other pathogens were identified. Unlike E bieneuri, this microsporidian appeared to develop within septated parasitophorous vacuoles, and lacked polar disks and clear clefts.

The detailed ultrastructure of life cycle of the pathogen including proliferative and sporogonic developmental stages are provided. All stages of the parasite are haplokaryotic and develop in a vacuole bounded by a single membrane in contact with host cell cytoplasm. Sporogenesis is synchronous with the same developmental stage in one vacuole.

Two genera, Endoreticulatus and Cystosporogenes, clearly separate into distinct but closely related clades based on small subunit ribosomal RNA analysis but are included in different families that are each polyphyletic. A microsporidium with morphology resembling the Endoreticulatus/Cystosporogenes clade was isolated from the grasshopper Poecilimon thoracicus from a site in Northwest Bulgaria. It produced intense infections in the digestive tract of the host but no behavioral changes were noted in infected individuals. Prevalence of the microsporidium increased over the active feeding season yearly. Mature spores were oval and measured 2.58±0.21μm×1.34±0.24μm, with 16 to approximately 32 spores in a parasitophorous vacuole. The spores were uninucleate and polar filament coils numbered 8–9 situated in a single row. The spore polaroplast consisted of an anterior lamellar section and a posterior vesicular section, and the posterior vacuole was reduced. Analyses of a 1221bp partial SSU-rRNA sequence indicated that the isolate is more closely related to the Endoreticulatus clade than to Cystosporogenes, but shows earlier phylogenetic separation from species infecting Lepidoptera and represents a new species, Endoreticulatus poecilimonae. To compare sequences of Endoreticulatus spp. from Lepidoptera to those infecting other insect orders, an isolate, Microsporidium itiiti Malone (1985), described from the Argentine stem weevil, Listronotus bonariensis, was sequenced. Like the grasshopper isolate, the weevil isolate is closely related but basal to the lepidopteran Endoreticulatus clade.

176,Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei,1,"Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei sp. nov. (Microsporida: Enterocytozoonidae), a parasite of the black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon (Decapoda: Penaeidae): Fine structure and phylogenetic relationships ::: Abstract A new microsporidian species, Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei sp. nov., is described from the hepatopancreas of the black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon (Crustacea: Decapoda). Different stages of the parasite are described, from early sporogonal plasmodia to mature spores in the cytoplasm of host-cells. The multinucleate sporogonal plasmodia existed in direct contact with the host-cell cytoplasm and contained numerous small blebs at the surface. Binary fission of the plasmodial nuclei occurred during early plasmodial development and numerous pre-sporoblasts were formed within the plasmodium. Electron-dense disks and precursors of the polar tubule developed in the cytoplasm of the plasmodium prior to budding of early sporoblasts from the plasmodial surface. Mature spores were oval, measuring 0.7×1.1μm and contained a single nucleus, 5–6 coils of the polar filament, a posterior vacuole, an anchoring disk attached to the polar filament, and a thick electron-dense wall. The wall was composed of a plasmalemma, an electron-lucent endospore (10nm) and an electron-dense exospore (2nm). DNA primers designed from microsporidian SSU rRNA were used to amplify an 848bp product from the parasite genome (GenBank Download FJ496356). The sequenced product had 84% identity to the matching region of SSU rRNA from Enterocytozoon bieneusi. Based upon ultrastructural features unique to the family Enterocytozoonidae, cytoplasmic location of the plasmodia and SSU rRNA sequence identity 16% different from E. bieneusi, the parasite was considered to be a new species, E. hepatopenaei, within the genus Enterocytozoon.",epithelium; hepatopancreas,epithelium; hepatopancreas,hepatopancreas; epithelium,hepatopancreas; Fine; plasmodia,1,2,1
183,Enterospora canceri,1,"Enterospora canceri n. gen., n. sp., intranuclear within the hepatopancreatocytes of the European edible crab Cancer pagurus ::: Only 1 genus (Nucleospora) within 1 family (Enterocytozoonidae) of the Microsporidia contains species that are parasitic within the nuclei of their host cells; to date, all described intranuclear Nucleospora spp. parasitise fish. This study describes the first intranuclear microsporidian parasite of an invertebrate, the European edible crab Cancer pagurus L. (Decapoda: Cancridae). Infected crabs displayed no obvious external signs, and maximum apparent prevalence of infection within a monthly sample was 3.45 %. Infected hepatopancreatic tubules were characterised by varying numbers of hypertrophic and eosinophilic nuclei within epithelial cells. Parasite stages appeared as eosinophilic granular accumulations causing margination of host chromatin. In advanced cases, the tubule epithelia degenerated, with parasites and sloughed epithelial cells appearing in tubule lumens. All life stages of the parasite were observed within host nuclei. Uninucleate meronts were not detected, although binucleate stages were observed. Multinucleate Plasmodia (sporogonal Plasmodia) contained up to 22 nuclei in section, and late-stage Plasmodia contained multiple copies of apparatus resembling the polar filament and anchoring disk, apparently associated with individual plasmodial nuclei. As such, aggregation and early assembly of sporoblast components took place within the intact sporogonial Plasmodium, a feature unique to the Enterocytozoonidae. Liberation of sporoblasts from Plasmodia or the presence of liberated sporoblasts was not observed in this study. However, large numbers of maturing and mature spores (measuring 1.3 ± 0.02 x 0.7 ± 0.01 μm) were frequently observed in direct contact with the host nucleoplasm. Considering the shared features of this parasite with microsporidians of the family Enterocytozoonidae, and the unique presence of this parasite within the nucleoplasm of decapod crustacean hepatopancreatocytes, this parasite (Enterospora canceri) is proposed as the type species of a new genus (Enterospora) of microsporidian.

184,Enterospora nucleophila,1,"A new intranuclear microsporidium, Enterospora nucleophila n. sp., causing an emaciative syndrome in a piscine host (Sparus aurata), prompts the redescription of the family Enterocytozoonidae ::: Graphical abstract Highlights • A new species of microsporidium is described from the intestine of a marine teleost. • The ultrastructural and molecular analyses place it within the Enterocytozoonidae. • The Enterocytozoonidae family is amended. • Intranuclear stages are free in the nucleoplasm and those in the cytoplasm are in a parasitophorous vacuole. • This microsporidium is a potential threat for cultured fish as it drastically reduces growth. Abstract The presence of a new microsporidium is believed to be responsible for an emaciative syndrome observed in farmed gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) from different facilities along the Spanish coast. Infected fish were approximately half the average weight and significant mortality was attributed to the condition in some facilities. Clinical signs included anorexia, cachexia and pale internal organs. The microsporidium was found mainly in the intestinal mucosa and occasionally in the submucosa. Morphological, histopathological, ultrastructural and molecular phylogenetic studies were conducted to characterise this organism. This microsporidium undergoes intranuclear development in rodlet cells and enterocytes, and cytoplasmic development mainly in enterocytes and macrophages. The nucleus-infecting plasmodium contains several diplokarya and displays polysporous development which occurs without an interfacial envelope. In the host cell cytoplasm, the parasite develops within a membrane-bound matrix. In both infection locations, the polar tube precursors appear as disks, first with lucent centres, then as fully dense disks as they fuse to form the polar filament, all before division of the plasmodium into sporoblasts. Up to 16 intranuclear spores result from the sporogonic development of a single plasmodium, whereas more than 40 spores result from several asynchronous reproductive cycles in the cytoplasmic infection. Fixed spores are ellipsoidal and diplokaryotic, with five to six coils of an isofilar polar filament in a single row. ssrDNA-based molecular phylogenetic inference places this parasite as a sister clade to crustacean-infecting species of the Enterocytozoonidae and closer to Enterocytozoon bieneusi than to other fish-infecting microsporidians presenting intranuclear development, i.e. Nucleospora, Paranucleospora and Desmozoon. Our studies result in the erection of a new species, Enterospora nucleophila, within the family Enterocytozoonidae, and the description of this family is amended accordingly to accommodate the features of known species assigned to it. Severe histopathological damage occurs in intense infections and this microsporidian is considered a serious emerging threat in sea bream production.",primarily intestine; rarely in the stomach,primarily intestine; rarely in the stomach,stomach; intestine,intestinal mucosa; intestine; intranuclear; submucosa,1,3,1

The parasite was found in sandflies collected in the commune of Roquedur, Gard, France, and represents the first microsporidium recorded from Old World sandflies. Meronts lie in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm and divide by binary fission or plasmotomy.

Transmission is direct. Flabelliforma is one of nine genera of microsporidia with multisporous sporogony, all but one of which are currently considered to belong to one family, Pleistophoridae, but in reality are not closely related.

In a heavy infection of the parasite xenomas develop in large number in various organs, viz., peritoneum, visceral cavity, ovaries, testis, fat body, pyloric caeca, spleen, muscle, liver, heart, gills, iris, etc., and cause serious damage to fish. The xenomas are variable in size, being 0.5-3 mm, rarely as large as 5 mm. Fresh spores of the parasite are elongate or ellipsoidal and are 5.1-6.2 x 2.0-2.5µ, the average of 200 spores being 5.8 x 2.1 Spores fixed in Bouin's solution and stained with Heidenhein's iron hematoxylin are 3.S-4.8 x 1.5-2.0 µ the average of 50 spores being 4.0 X 1.8 µ. Everted filaments are 180 µ at maximum, being 100-150 µ in the majority. The processes of schizogony and sporogony of the parasite studied with artificially infected ayu are in substance the same as those reported by Weissenberg (1968) on Glugea anomala and by Sprague and Yernick (1968) on G. weissenbergu A very small xenoma of 4x8 µ with a single schizont and a single host cell nucleus was found in the lamina propria of the villi of the gut of an ayu killed 5 days after infection. Sporonts in smear preparations of parasite are 3 x 4 µ and each sporont produce two spores. Therefore the parasite is classified into the genus Glugea. Inoculation experiments have shown that Salmo gairdneri is susceptible to the parasite, but. Gasterosteus acelatus microcephalus is unsusceptible. Of about 15 species of Glugea in fish, G. hertwigi has spores similar in size to those of the present Glugea, But the former differs from the latter in the following points. The hosts of G. hertwigi are Osmerus mordax and O. eperlanus and it has been reported by Weissenberg (1968) that Gasterosteus aceleatus is susceptible to G. hertwigi, G. anomala and G. weissenhergi are distinguishable in having smaller spores, 3 x 1.5-2 µ, and larger spores, 6.0-7.0 X 2.5-3.6 µ, respectively, and in having different hosts, the sticklebacks.

(Microsporidia: Glugeidae) infecting the lizardfish Saurida lessepsianus (Pisces: Synodontidae) inhabiting the Red Sea ::: Heterosporosis is an increasingly important microsporidian disease distributed worldwide, impacting wild and farmed-raised fish in both fresh and marine water environments. Twenty three out of 130 (17.69%) of the lizardfish Saurida lessepsianus were found to be naturally infected with microsporidian parasites. The rate of parasitic infection was increased during winter reaching 29.23% (19/65) and fall to 6.15% (4/65) in summer. The infection was recorded as numerous macroscopic whitish cysts reached 3.8–6.5 mm in diameter embedded in the abdominal cavity, skeletal muscles and mesenteric tissues of the infected fish inducing an enormous hypertrophy of infected tissues. Light microscopic examination revealed that parasitic foci were encapsulated by a host–derived fibrous membrane containing different developmental stages of the parasite. Spores were oval to pyriform in shape. Transmission electron microscopic study showed the presence of smooth membranes of the sarcoplasmic reticulum forming a thick, amorphous coat surrounding the various developmental stages of the examined parasite (meronts, sporont, sporoblasts, and spores). Mature spores were electron dense and uninucleate. The anchoring disk was found in a central position at the anterior end of the spore and a large vacuole was located at the posterior end. There was a definite number (7–8) of the polar filament turns. Molecular analysis based on the 16 small subunit (SSU) rDNA gene was performed to determine the phylogenetic position of the present parasite species. A 615 bp region of the 16SSU rDNA gene of the studied parasite was sequenced and deposited in GenBank under the accession number MF769371. Multiple sequence alignment demonstrated a high degree of similarity (>82%) with other twenty microsporidian species isolated from different aquatic hosts. The most closely related sequence was provided by the GenBank entry JF745533 for Heterosporis saurida isolated from the marine fish Saurida undosquamis with the highest percentage of identity (98%) and lowest divergence value (0.9).

241,Hyperspora aquatica,1,"Hyperspora aquatica n.gn., n.sp. (Microsporidia), hyperparasitic in Marteilia cochillia (Paramyxida), is closely related to crustacean-infecting microspordian taxa ::: SUMMARY The Paramyxida, closely related to haplosporidians, paradinids, and mikrocytids, is an obscure order of parasitic protists within the class Ascetosporea. All characterized ascetosporeans are parasites of invertebrate hosts, including molluscs, crustaceans and polychaetes. Representatives of the genus Marteilia are the best studied paramyxids, largely due to their impact on cultured oyster stocks, and their listing in international legislative frameworks. Although several examples of microsporidian hyperparasitism of paramyxids have been reported, phylogenetic data for these taxa are lacking. Recently, a microsporidian parasite was described infecting the paramyxid Marteilia cochillia, a serious pathogen of European cockles. In the current study, we investigated the phylogeny of the microsporidian hyperparasite infecting M. cochillia in cockles and, a further hyperparasite, Unikaryon legeri infecting the digenean Meiogymnophallus minutus, also in cockles. We show that rather than representing basally branching taxa in the increasingly replete Cryptomycota/Rozellomycota outgroup (containing taxa such as Mitosporidium and Paramicrosoridium), these hyperparasites instead group with other known microsporidian parasites infecting aquatic crustaceans. In doing so, we erect a new genus and species (Hyperspora aquatica n. gn., n.sp.) to contain the hyperparasite of M. cochillia and clarify the phylogenetic position of U. legeri. We propose that in both cases, hyperparasitism may provide a strategy for the vectoring of microsporidians between hosts of different trophic status (e.g. molluscs to crustaceans) within aquatic systems. In particular, we propose that the paramyxid hyperparasite H. aquatica may eventually be detected as a parasite of marine crustaceans. The potential route of transmission of the microsporidian between the paramyxid (in its host cockle) to crustaceans, and, the ‘hitch-hiking’ strategy employed by H. aquatica is discussed.",Primary cells,Primary cells,Primary cells,cockles,0,1,1
242,Ichthyosporidium weissii,1,"Ichthyosporidium weissii n. sp. (Microsporidia) Infecting the Arrow Goby ( Clevelandia ios) ::: Abstract Gonadal infections by a novel microsporidium were discovered in 34% (13/38) of arrow gobies, Clevelandia ios, sampled over a 3‐yr period from Morro Bay Marina in Morro Bay, California. Gonadal tumors had been reported in arrow gobies from this geographic area. The infected gonads, found primarily in females, typically appeared grossly as large, white‐gray firm and lobulated masses. Histological examination revealed large, multilobate xenomas within the ovaries and no evidence of neoplasia. Typical of the genus Ichthyosporidium, the large xenomas were filled with developmental stages and pleomorphic spores. Wet mount preparations showed two general spore types: microspores with mean length of 6.2 (7.0–4.9, SD = 0.6, N = 20) μm and mean width of 4.3 (5.3–2.9, SD = 0.8) μm; and less numerous macrospores with mean length of 8.5 (10.1–7.1, SD = 1.0, N = 10) μm and mean width of 5.5 (6.2–4.8, SD = 0.5) μm. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated stages consistent with the genus and 35–50 turns of the polar filament. Small subunit rDNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the parasite from arrow gobies was most closely related to, but distinct from Ichthyosporidium sp. based on sequences available in GenBank. We conclude that this microsporidium represents a new species of Ichthyosporidium, the first species of this genus described from a member of the family Gobiidae and from the Pacific Ocean.",Connective tissue in Gonad,Connective tissue in Gonad,Connective tissue,Morro,0,1,1

(Microsporida: Amblyosporidae) from the predacious mosquito Culex fuscanus Wiedemann (Diptera: Culicidae) ::: A microsporidium infecting the predacious mosquito Culex fuscanus Wiedemann, collected from Liu-Chiu Islet of Taiwan, was shown to be heterosporous. Two different types of haploid spores, one oval and the other lanceolate, were concurrently produced in the infected larvae. Merogony preceding the sequence leading to oval meiospores ended with the formation of a binucleate sporont with similar ultrastructural features to meronts. Synaptonemal complexes, suggesting that meiosis was involved during this sporogony, appeared in both nuclei of the sporont. The polar filament in the mature meiospore was anisofilar. Nine coiled turns of the polar filament were shown turning about the posterior portion of the spore. The polaroplast was composed of an anterior lamellate part and a posterior vesicular part. The anchoring disc was at the top of the straight portion of the polar filament. The meront of the lanceolate spore cannot be confirmed in this study. Two uninucleate lanceolate spores were eventually formed via nuclear dissociation. The polaroplast of the lanceolate spore was divided into an anterior multi-chambered part and a posterior of reticulate part. The polar filament was of the isofilar type, consisting of at least 5-6 coils. This parasite was extremely similar to the species Amblyospora trinus; in spore shape and development; but different in spore size and their hosts. Although it was similar to species of Amblyospora in host/parasite relations, we would rather assign this parasite to a newly established genus, i.e. Intrapredatorus and the name Intrapredatorus barri n.g., n.sp. was given for this microsporidium.

(Microspora, Tuzetiidae), a Microsporidian Parasite of Ptychoptera paludosa (Diptera, Ptychopteridae) ::: The microsporidium Janacekia adipophila n. sp., a parasite of Ptychoptera paludosa larvae in Sweden, is described based on light microscopic and ultrastructural characteristics. Merogonial stages and sporonts are diplokaryotic. Merozoites are formed by rosette‐like division. Sporonts develop into sporogonial plasmodia with isolated nuclei. These plasmodia give rise to 8–16 sporoblasts by rosette‐like budding. A sporophorous vesicle is initiated by the sporogonial plasmodium. Sporoblasts and spores are enclosed in individual sporophorous vesicles. Granular inclusions of the vesicles, visible using light microscopy, discriminate sporogonial stages from stages of the merogony. The monokaryotic, fresh spores are oval with blunt ends, measuring 4.2‐6.3 × 9.1‐11.2 μm. Macrospores are formed in small numbers. The spore wall has three subdivisions and the exospore is electron‐dense. The polaroplast has two parts: closely arranged lamellae anteriorly, wider sac‐like compartments posteriorly. The isofilar polar filament, 191–264 nm wide, has 12‐13 coils, which are arranged in one layer in the posterior half of the spore. The electron‐dense inclusions of the sporophorous vesicle are modified during sporogony, and vesicles with mature spores are traversed by 21–27 nm wide tubules, which connect the exospore with the envelope of the vesicle. The walls of the tubules, the envelope of the vesicles, and the surface layer of the exospore are all identical double‐layered structures.

This parasite develops in the skeletal muscle of the abdominal cavity, forming whitish cyst-like structures containing numerous spores. Mature spores, lightly pyriform to ellipsoidal with rounded ends and measuring 4.25 ± 0.38 X 2.37 ± 0.42 μm (n = 30), were observed. The spore wall, which measured about 102 nm, was composed of 2 layers with approximately the same thickness. The isofilar polar filament was coiled, with 9-10 (rarely 8) turns. The posterior vacuole appeared as a pale area, occupying about 1/3 of the spore length, and contained a spherical posterosome composed of granular material that was denser at the periphery. The myofibrils located near the spores appeared to be in advanced degradation. Molecular analysis of the rRNA genes, including the ITS region, and phylogenetic analyses using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Baysesian inference were performed. The ultrastructural characteristics of the spores and the phylogenetic data strongly suggested that it is a new species related to Kabatana, Microgemma, Potaspora, Spraguea, and Tetramicra.

288,Loma sp.,1,"Loma sp. in salmonids from the eastern united states: Associated lesions in rainbow trout ::: A microsporidian of the genus Loma was noted in the gills of rainbow trout Onco-rhynchus mykiss from a state hatchery (Buford Trout Hatchery) in Georgia. Mortalities of varying severity occur at this hatchery every fall, and the microsporidian was noted during an experiment from August 1991 to January 1992 to determine the effects of water source on disease. Infections first appeared to be systemic in the October sample; xenomas were observed in heart, spleen, and peripheral vessel walls. The presence of unidentified intracellular material preceded the appearance of xenomas in all tissues, but whether this material was associated with inflammation or represented immature stages of the parasite has yet to be determined. These structures were also noted in the intestine and liver, although xenomas were not noted in these organs. Mature xenomas did not elicit an inflammatory response but appeared to be short-lived. When the xenoma wall ruptured and released spores, an inflammatory response was again observed. The prevalence and severity of the infection were determined in fish maintained in troughs with well water, Chattahoochee River water, or hatchery (treated river) water. The infection tended to be more prevalent and more severe in fish maintained in the hatchery or river water than in those maintained in the well water. Stress induced by poor water quality may increase mortality from this parasite.

292,Merocinta davidii,1,"Ultrastructure and life cycle of Merocinta davidii gen et sp. nov, a dimorphic microsporidian parasite of Mansonia africana (Diptera: Culicidae) from Tanzania ::: Mansonia africana larvae were sampled at three sites in NE Tanzania, between June and September 1987. At each site between 2.5 and 5.7% were infected with a multisporous microsporidian parasite. The ovoid spores measured 2.5 × 1.5 •m. Meronts were diplokaryotic with electron-dense, thickened unit membranes. Repeated division of the diplokarya gave rise to multinucleate plasmodia, the plasma membrane of which was entirely surrounded by two other membranes interpreted as host endoplasmic reticulum. Both membranes were studded with ribosomes. Meronts became ribbon-like before division, the endoplasmic reticulum dividing with the parasite. At the onset of sporogony the two nuclei of the diplokaryon separated and the electron-dense coat was sloughed off. Nuclear division and cytoplasmic division gave rise to uninucleate sporoblasts and spores. Adult M. africana collected at one of the three sites were infected with two diplokaryotic microsporidia, designated Type A and Type B, which differed only in the size of the spores. Spores of Type A measured 3.4 ×1.8 •m and those of Type B measured 6.6 × 2.9 •m; both types were binucleate. Type A infected 10.8 and Type B 5.8% of the adults collected. Mixed infections were not observed. In transovarial transmission trials, larvae were not successfully reared from adults infected with Type B. However, 11.3% of progeny from females infected with Type A exhibited multisporous microsporidian infections indistinguishable from those found in larvae collected at that site, showing that the multisporous parasite in larvae and the Type A infection of adults represent different stages in the life cycle of a single species. The morphology and life cycle of this microsporidian exclude it from all other related genera and it is attributed here to a new genus and given the name Merocinta davidii.",midgut (larva); ovary (adult),midgut; ovary,midgut; ovary,Type,0,1,2
293,Metchnikovella sp. (?),1,"The influence of an eucaryotic intranuclear cell parasite on the production of gemmules in Ephydatia fluviatilis (Porifera, Spongillidae) ::: A prerequisite for the production of gemmules is the presence of intact archaeocytes and trophocytes, which give rise to the thesocytes with which the gemmule is eventually filled. The coat enclosing the gemmule requires spongioblasts for its formation and incorporates amphidisk spicules, which develop in amphidiskoblasts. The cell parasite, the development of which is described here, infects mainly archaeocytes but also spongioblasts and amphidiskoblasts. Even a moderate infection results in significant malformation of the gemmule covering. In the thesocyte nucleus, the parasite can survive the resting phase of the gemmule. After the gemmule has hatched, the parasite, again in the virulent form, is present in the young, developing sponge. The parasite may be a microsporidian of the primitive type, close to the genus Metchnikovella, which typically occurs in gregarines.",archaeocytes; spongioblasts; amphidiskoblasts,archaeocytes; spongioblasts; amphidiskoblasts,archaeocytes; spongioblasts; amphidiskoblasts,archaeocytes; spongioblasts; cell,2,1,1

(Microsporidia), a parasite of the fish Trachinotus carolinus (Carangidae) in Southern Brazil ::: SUMMARY A new species of Microsporidia Microgemma carolinus n. sp. found in the marine teleost Trachinotus carolinus collected in Florianópolis, Brazil was described based on light, ultrastructural and phylogenetic studies. This parasite developed in the liver forming whitish xenomas that contained different developmental stages with monokaryotic nuclei. The periphery of the xenoma presented some vacuolization and possessed several small projections in the membrane. The mature spores, measuring 3·8 ± 0·4 μm in length and 2·4 ± 0·4 μm in width, were slightly pyriform to ellipsoidal and had rounded ends. The polaroplast was bipartite and the isofilar polar filament was coiled with 8 – 9 turns in a single or double row at the posterior end of the spore. The nucleus was voluminous and in a central position, measuring ∼0·9 μm in diameter. A large posterior vacuole appeared as a pale area, occupying about a third of the spore length. The SSU rRNA gene was sequenced and analysed using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and neighbour-joining methods. This study allowed us to conclude that this was a new species of the genus Microgemma, being the first description of this genus from among South America fauna.",Liver,Liver,Liver,spore; pale,0,2,1

The microsporidian forms macroscopic xenomas in the host liver which are packed with mature spores. Mature spores are slightly pyriform to oval in shape measuring 3.92 ± 0.21 μm in length and 2.87 ±0.16 pm in width. No pre-spore stages were observed during electron microscopy studies and mature spores had a single nucleus and 12-13 turns of an isofilar polar filament, arranged in two rows. Sequencing of the ribosomal DNA indicated a strong phylogenetic relationship within the Tetramicridae and to other members of the genus Microgemma. The most similar species in terms of genetic distance is M. carolinus with a similarity of 99.23% over 1295 bases of the small subunit of ribosomal DNA. However, differences in the number of turns of the polar filament combined with host and geographical differences, support M. tilanpasiri as a novel microsporidian species. This represents the first description of Microgemma from the Western Pacific and the first from the Gobiidae family of fishes. Related blackfin eel gobies from the same sampling site were found to be uninfected with M. tilanpasiri; however one fish was infected with Glugea sp. in the visceral mesentery. We conclude that in spite of the low genetic distances observed in ribosomal DNA sequences between geographically distant xenoma-forming microsporidians from both Microgemma and Glugea, that they probably represent a number of different species of parasite that may actually be quite host specific.",liver,liver,liver,eel gobies; Trypauchen vagina; visceral mesentery,0,3,1

The spores were 1.3 mm long and had a thick 3‐layered coat. An anchoring disc and polar aperture were present. The polaroplast occupied most of the anterior half of the spore. The vesicular portion included lengths of loosely packed lamellar structures as well as the usual vesicular profiles embedded in fibrillar material; it was entirely surrounded by tightly packed, electron‐dense lamellae.

Twenty three (30.6 %) out of 75 of the examined fish were parasitized with a microsporidian parasite. Numerous macroscopic whitish cysts embedded in the peritoneal cavity were observed to infect many organs of the body including muscles, connective tissues, and the intestinal epithelium. The infection was developed as tumor-like masses of often up to 5 mm in diameter inducing an enormous hypertrophy to the infected organs. Fresh spores appeared mostly ovoid to pyriform in shape reaching a size of 1.7 ± 0.5 (1.5–2.5) μm × 1.3 ± 0.4 (1–2) μm; they possessed a large vacuole at the posterior end. These spores were located within a sporophorous vesicle which was bound by a thick amorphous wall. The ultrastructural features support the placement of the present species within the genus Microsporidium. The developmental stages were enclosed within a xenoma structure that was bounded by a double-layered cyst wall. The life cycle of the microsporidian pathogen described herein included four stages: proliferation (merogony), sporogony, sporoblast, spores, and liberation. Mature spores appeared electron dense, uninucleate, and were ellipsoidal in shape. At the anterior end of the spore, the anchoring disk was found in a central position. There was a definite number (5–11) of turns of the polar tube. A 538-bp region of the SSU rDNA gene of the studied species was sequenced (GenBank accession number: KF0220444). Multiple sequence alignment calculated a high degree of similarity (>92 %) with six microsporidian species. The most closely related sequence was provided by the GenBank entry AF151529 for Microsporidium prosopium isolated from Hyperoplus lanceolatus differing in 67 nucleotide positions in its SSU rDNA with the highest percentage of identity (97.2 %) and the lowest divergence value (0.20). Variations in the morphology of the spores and developmental stages between the two species revealed that the two species are different. The site of infection in the host and description of the onset of parasite development are strong criteria for the placement of the microsporidian parasite of the fish S. aurata within the genus Microsporidium as a new species, and we propose to name it Microsporidium aurata nov. sp.",general infection (of organs); muscles; connective tissues; and the intestinal epithelium,general infection; muscles; connective tissues; and the intestinal epithelium,general infection; intestinal epithelium; connective tissues; muscles,intestinal epithelium; connective tissues; spore; Microsporidium aurata nov.; vacuole; gilthead seabream Sparus aurata; muscles; organs; peritoneal cavity,3,6,1

(Tubificidae) is described. The microsporean occurred together with an actinosporean of the genus Triactinomyxon, which was found between the epithelial cells. The merogonic and sporogonic stages (mature spores included) of the microsporean parasite are monokaryotic. An individual sporophorous vesicle surrounds each spore. The fixed and stained spore has an average dimension of 1.9-2.5 x 0.9-1.2 microm. The spores are oval with a characteristic surface layer, showing ornamentation-like projections, which are in close contact to the exospore.

Diagnosis was originally based on light microscopy, and was confirmed by PCR amplification and electron microscopy. This is the first record of microsporidia infection in the insect order Psocoptera. Four morphological spore types corresponded to four original SSUrDNA sequences (Genbank accession no. FJ865221-24), suggesting infection with four microsporidia species. Two of those species were examined by electron microscopy. We describe here one new genus and two new species based on morphological and sequence data: Antonospora psocopterae sp. n. with elongated diplokaryotic spores, 4.4±0.05×1.9±0.03μm and Mockfordia xanthocaeciliae gen. n. sp. n. with ovocylindrical monokaryotic spores, 2.5±0.10×1.4±0.02μm.

A new species of Microsporidia classified to a new genus was observed in the trunk muscle of commercial hake (Merluccius capensis/paradoxus complex) from Namibian fisheries. Macroscopic examination revealed thin and dark filaments inserted among muscle fibers. Inside the filaments were many sporophorous vesicles with about 30–50 spores per vesicle. The shape of the spore was pyriform and the extruded polar filament was of moderate length (up to 4.29 μm, n=12). This new species of Microsporidia is described using macrophotography, microphotography, staining, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as well as molecular methods. Its 16S rRNA was found to be similar to that of Microsporidium prosopium Kent et al., 1999, while both sequences were quite different from 16S rRNA sequences known for other Microsporidia.

Plurinucleate Plasmodia with nuclei arranged as diplokarya divide, probably by plasmotomy, producing a small number of diplokaryotic merozoites. The number of merogonial cycles is unknown. Each diplokaryotic sporont yields eight monokaryotic sporoblasts in a thin‐walled, more or less fusiform sporophorous vesicle. A small number of multisporoblastic sporophorous vesicles were observed, in which a part of the sporoblasts were anomalous. The sporogony probably begins with a meiotic division. The mature spores are slightly pyriform. Fixed and stained spores measure 2.1‐2.4 × 3.7‐4.5 μm. The five‐layered spore wall is of the Napamichum type. The polar filament is anisofilar with seven to eight coils (142‐156 and 120 nm wide). The angle of tilt is 55‐65°. The polaroplast has an anterior lamellar and a posterior tubular part. The granular, tubular and crystal‐like inclusions of the episporontal space disappear more or less completely when the spores mature.

Here, we describe the discovery of a natural microsporidian parasite of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that displays a unique tissue tropism compared to previously described parasites of this host. We characterize the life cycle of this new species, Nematocida displodere, including pathogen entry, intracellular replication, and exit. N. displodere can invade multiple host tissues, including the epidermis, muscle, neurons, and intestine of C. elegans. Despite robust invasion of the intestine very little replication occurs there, with the majority of replication occurring in the muscle and epidermis. This feature distinguishes N. displodere from two closely related microsporidian pathogens, N. parisii and N. sp. 1, which exclusively invade and replicate in the intestine. Comparison of the N. displodere genome with N. parisii and N. sp. 1 reveals that N. displodere is the earliest diverging species of the Nematocida genus. Over 10% of the proteins encoded by the N. displodere genome belong to a single species-specific family of RING-domain containing proteins of unknown function that may be mediating interactions with the host. Altogether, this system provides a powerful whole-animal model to investigate factors responsible for pathogen growth in different tissue niches.",epidermis; muscle; neurons; intestine; coelomocytes; and seam cells,epidermis; muscle; neurons; intestine; coelomocytes; and seam cells,neurons; seam cells; intestine; muscle; coelomocytes; epidermis,neurons; tissue; N. sp. 1; intestine; parisii; muscle; host tissues; epidermis,4,4,2

375,Nosema adaliae,1,"Nosema adaliae sp. nov., a new microsporidian pathogen from the two-spotted lady beetle, Adalia bipunctata L. (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and its relationship to microsporidia that infect other coccinellids ::: Graphical abstract Highlights • This is the first formal description of a microsporidium from Adalia bipunctata. • Diplokaryotic spores (6.10×3.01μm) had isofilar polar filaments with 10–18 coils. • Flight muscles and fat body were the most heavily infected host tissues. • The genome sequence of the microsporidium was 97% similar to Nosema bombi. Abstract The two-spotted lady beetle, Adalia bipunctata L., is a tree-dwelling lady beetle endemic to parts of Europe, Central Asia and North America that is commercially available for aphid control in Europe and North America. Lady beetles host a wide variety of symbionts including parasitoids, viruses, eugregarines, fungi, bacteria, nematodes and microsporidia. Four species of microsporidia have been described from lady beetles, and an undescribed microsporidium was recently isolated from local populations of A. bipunctata in Nova Scotia, Canada. In a previous study, this pathogen prolonged the development of A. bipunctata larvae but had no effect on adult fecundity, longevity or sex ratios. The objective of this study was to formally describe the microsporidium by means of its ultrastructure, tissue pathology and molecular characterization. All stages of the microsporidium were diplokaryotic and developed in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm. Mature spores measured 4.25±0.09×1.82±0.03μm (SE, n=49, from micrographs) and fresh spores measured 6.10±0.06×3.01±0.05μm (±SE, n=60; range: 5.0–6.9×2.18–3.86μm). The polar filament was isofilar with 10–18 coils that were frequently arranged in a single row. The lamellar polaroplast was not typically visible and spores contained a relatively small posterior vacuole. Both the flight muscles and fat body were heavily infected and a large number of spores were observed within and between the cells of these tissues. The ovaries, developing oocytes, spermatocytes and accessory glands within the testes, midgut epithelium, Malpighian tubules, ileum, colon, and ventral nerve cord were also infected but not as heavily. Connective tissue near the cuticle and surrounding the trachea were lightly infected. The presence of spores in both the alimentary canal and ovaries (particularly within developing oocytes) suggests that the microsporidium can be transmitted per os (horizontally) and transovarially (vertically). Molecular analysis of the genome of the microsporidium described in this study was 97% similar to Nosema bombi and 96% similar to Nosema thomsoni, Nosema vespula and Nosema oulemae. Based on information gained during this study, we propose that the microsporidium in A. bipunctata be given the name Nosema adaliae sp.

Although lacewings are known for their symbiotic association with yeasts and bacteria, there are few reports of microsporidia in these natural enemies. An undescribed microsporidium was found in Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) during the routine examination of specimens that were obtained from a commercial insectary for biological pest control. The objective of this study was to describe the pathogen by means of ultrastructure, molecular characterization and tissue pathology. All stages of the microsporidium were diplokaryotic and developed in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm. Merogony and sporogony were not observed. Mature spores measured 3.49±0.10×1.52±0.05μm and had an isofilar polar filament with 8–10 coils that were frequently arranged in a single row, although double rows were also observed. Spores contained a lamellar polaroplast and a relatively small and inconspicuous polar vacuole was observed in the posterior region of about half of the spores that were examined. Tubular structures, similar in appearance to those in Nosema granulosis were observed in both sporonts and in spores. A cluster of small tubules was also observed in the posterior region of some spores. Microsporidian spores were observed in cells of the proventriculus, diverticulum and in epithelial cells of the posterior midgut. The Malpighian tubules, ileum, and rectum were heavily infected. Spores were also observed in the fat body, peripheral region of the ganglia, within and between the flight muscles, and beneath the cuticle. Although the tissues adjacent to the ovaries were heavily infected, microsporidian spores were not observed within the developing eggs. Pathogen transmission was not studied directly because it was difficult to maintain microsporidia-infected C. carnea in the laboratory. The presence of microsporidian spores in the alimentary canal suggests that the pathogen is transmitted per os and horizontal transmission may occur when infected larvae or adults are cannibalized by uninfected larvae. Molecular analysis of the microsporidian genome showed that the pathogen described in this study was 99% similar to Nosema bombycis, N. furnacalis, N. granulosis and N. spodopterae. Based on information gained during this study, we propose that the microsporidium in C. carnea be given the name Nosema chrysoperlae sp.

Its life cycle includes two sequential developmental cycles that are similar to the general developmental cycles of the Nosema-like microsporidia and are indistinguishable from those of two Nosema spp. from Lymantria dispar. The primary cycle takes place in the midgut tissues and produces binucleate primary spores. The secondary developmental cycle takes place exclusively in the silk glands and produces binucleate environmental spores. N. chrysorrhoeae is specific to the browntail moth.

412,Nosema granulosis,1,"Ultrastructural characterisation and molecular taxonomic identification of Nosema granulosis n. sp., a transovarially transmitted feminising (TTF) microsporidium ::: A novel microsporidian parasite is described, which infects the crustacean host Gammarus duebeni. The parasite was transovarially transmitted and feminised host offspring. The life cycle was monomorphic with three stages. Meronts were found in host embryos, juveniles, and in the gonadal tissue of adults. Sporoblasts and spores were restricted to the gonad. Sporogony was disporoblastic giving rise to paired sporoblasts, which then differentiated to form spores. Spores were not found in regular groupings and there was no interfacial envelope. Spores were approximately 3.78 x 1.22 microns and had a thin exospore wall, a short polar filament, and an unusual granular polaroplast. All life cycle stages were diplokaryotic. A region from the parasite small subunit ribosomal RNA gene was amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis based on these data places the parasite within the genus Nosema. We have named the species Nosema granulosis based on the structure of the polaroplast.",gonadal tissue (adult); subcuticular cells (juvenile); systemic infection (embryo); embryo,gonadal tissue; subcuticular cells; systemic infection; embryo,gonadal tissue; subcuticular cells; embryo; systemic infection,gonadal tissue; Nosema granulosis n. sp.; interfacial,1,2,3

All life stages are unikaryotic, but analysis of the consensus small subunit region of the ribosomal gene places this microsporidium in the genus Nosema, which historically has been characterized by diplokaryotic life stages. It is also characterized by having the reversed arrangement of the ribosomal gene (LSU –ITS‐ SSU) found in species within the “true Nosema” clade. This microsporidium is apparently Holarctic in distribution. It is present in H. halys both where it is native in Asia and where it is invasive in North America, as well as in samples of North American native C. hilaris collected prior to the introduction of H. halys from Asia. Prevalence in H. halys from mid‐Atlantic, North America in 2015–2016 ranged from 0.0% to 28.3%, while prevalence in C. hilaris collected in Illinois in 1970–1972 ranged from 14.3% to 58.8%. Oral infectivity and pathogenicity were confirmed in H. halys and C. hilaris.

In the present study, a microsporidian pathogen, Nosema melasomae infecting Crysomela populi is re-recorded from a new geographical locality and its spore ultrastructure is given for the first time. Methods: Larvae and adults of C. populi were dissected in Ringer’s solution and prepared wet smears were examined under a microscope. Detected fresh and stained spores were measured and photographed using an Olympus BX51 micro- scope with a DP-25 digital camera and a DP2-BSW Soft Imaging System. The ultrastructure of the pathogen was studied with a Philips EM 208 transmission electron microscope using standard preparation techniques as previously described Results:Fresh spores of the microsporidian pathogen are elongate, 4.86 ± 0.71 µm in length and 1.64 ± 0.19 µm in width. The spore wall is considerable thin, measured 60 to 100 nm and consists of a clear endospore (40 to 80 nm) and an electron-dense, uniform exospore (15 to 30 nm). The polar filament is isofilar and has only 6-8 coils. Nuclei in the cell are 400-560 nm in diameter. The polaroplast has a thin lamellated structure. Conclusion:The pathogen from C. populi is N. melasomae Sidor & Jodal, 1986 and its systematic position given by Sidor and Jodal.

Structures resembling microsporidian spores were found by microscopic examination of honeybees from Uganda. Molecular confirmation failed when PCR primers specific for Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae were used, but was successful with primers covering the whole family of Nosematidae. We performed transmission electron microscopy and found typical microsporidian spores which were smaller (length: 2.36±0.14μm and width: 1.78±0.06μm; n=6) and had fewer polar filament coils (10–12) when compared to those of known species infecting honeybees. The entire 16S SSU rRNA region was amplified, cloned and sequenced and was found to be unique with the highest resemblance (97% identity) to N. apis.

The microsporidia infect eggs, all larval stages and moths of both sexes of the borer. Infection of the eggs implies that transovarial transmission occurs. Spores of constant size are produced, meronts are mainly binucleated but may contain up to eight nuclei. Presporoblastic meronts are single structures, there are no linear or colony formations. Individual diplokaryotic sporoblasts are chromophilic, and slight overstaining produces almost black spherical and oval structures. The diplokaryotic nucleus is characterized by an achromatic line less than 1 mu-m in width which divides it through its centre. This characteristic does not occur in other species of Nosema and is unique to N. partelli. It occurs through all developmental stages from the diplokaryotic sporoblast to the encysting spores. Sporogony is heralded by spindle-shaped diplokaryotic sporoblasts. Diplokaryotic sporonts decrease in size, their nuclei tend to become smaller and pyknotic, after which visible detail is lost following encystment.",fat body; Malpighian tubules; muscles; alimentary canal; egg,fat body; Malpighian tubules; muscles; alimentary canal; egg,alimentary canal; Malpighian tubules; egg; muscles; fat body,borer.,0,1,5

In this study, we presented its morphological and some molecular characteristics. The mature spores were measured to be 4.36 × 1.49 μm. The spore wall consisted of an electron-dense exospore (EX) and electron-lucent endospore (EN) layer. The polar filament (PF) was isofilar with 10–12 coils that were frequently arranged in a single row. Investigation results indicated that N. pernyi can infect the gut wall, silk glands, and other tissues. A full-length SMART cDNA library of N. pernyi was constructed, and then 824 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were sequenced. Ninety unigenes, out of 197 assembled unigenes, showed significant homology to known genes of Nosema ceranae, Nosema bombycis, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, and other microsporidian species. Based on the nucleotide sequence of the α- and β-tubulin genes and amino acid sequence of actin gene, phylogenetic trees analysis showed that N. pernyi was closely related to Nosema philosamiae and Nosema antheraeae.

This microsporidium infects most body tissues of the host. N. pilicornis was compared to other microsporidian species infecting Hymenoptera and to a group of similar microsporidia infecting Lepidoptera. N. pilicornis could be distinguished from all other microsporidian species on the basis of host range and ultrastructural characteristics of the spore.

Collected in Portugal ::: A microsporidium Nosema portugal n. sp. was isolated from gypsy moths, Lymantria dispar L, collected near Lisbon, Portugal, in 1985. The Life cycle includes two sequential developmental cycles, a primary and a secondary cycle. The primary cycle occurs in midgut epithelial cells, where primary spores are produced within 48 h. The primary spores immediately extrude their polar filaments, presumably to infect other cells. In the target tissues (salivary glands and fat body) the secondary development cycle is followed by the formation of environmental spores. Primary spores were also sometimes present in target tissues. Fresh unfixed and unstained primary spores have a large posterior vacuole and measured 4.8 x 2.7 mu m. Ultrastructurally, they have 5-8 polar filament coils, a large posterior vacuole, abundant endoplasmic reticulum, and were binucleate. Mature unfixed and unstained environmental spores were highly refractive and the posterior vacuole and nuclei could not be seen through the spore coat. Fresh environmental spores measured 4.5 x 1.9 mu m. Ultrastructurally, environmental spores were binucleate, with a typical polaroplast, 10-11 isofilar polar filament coils, and a series of 4-6 thin polar filament-like tubules situated at the posterior end of the row of typical polar filament coils.

Unlike N. carpocapsae (which also parasitizes most of the host tissue), N. telengae is parasitic only in L. pyrivora; experimental infection of L. pomonella was unsuccessful.",systemic infection (except hypodermis and nervous tissue),systemic infection,systemic infection,host tissue; tissues; nervous tissue; N.; hypodermis; Laspeyresia pyrivora,0,6,1
482,Nosema transitellae,1,"Studies on the biology and ultrastructure of nosema transitellae sp. n. (microsporidia: Nosematidae) in the navel orangeworm, paramyelois transitella (lepidoptera: Pyralidae) ::: Nosema transitellae sp. n. was originally isolated from larvae of the navel orangeworm, Paramyelois transitella, reared on contaminated trash almonds. The life cycle of the pathogen includes the formation of quadrinucleate schizonts and sporonts that divide to form twin binucleate sporoblasts typical of the genus Nosema. The pathogen primarily invades fat and the silk and salivary glands. Larvae with heavy infections frequently develop melanized encapsulated fat lobes that are visible beneath the transparent cuticle. In laboratory tests, only the navel orangeworm and the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, acquired lethal infections. The almond moth, Cadra cautella, the raisin moth, Cadra figulilella, the tobacco moth, Ephestia elutella, and the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella, acquired benign infections. The sawtoothed grain beetle, Oryzaephilus surinamensis, was not susceptible. The ultrastructure of the spores of N. transitellae is similar to that of spores of N. whitei and N. oryzaephili.","Fat and silk of salivary glands; to a lesser extent: midgut;

484,Nosema tyriae,1,"Nosema tyriae n.sp. and Nosema sp., microsporidian parasites of Cinnabar moth Tyria jacobaeae ::: Nosema tyriae n.sp. was found in 63% of a population of Cinnabar moth larvae (Tyria jacobaeae). The infection was found in the gut wall, silk glands, and fat body and was probably generalized but appeared to be of low pathogenicity. Merogony and sporogony were by binary fission of diplokaryotic stages. Fresh spores were elongate, slightly pointed at the anterior end, and measured 4.7 x 2.0 microm. Ultrastructural features of special interest were 20-nm tubules connecting the surface of sporonts with host cell cytoplasm and, in the spores, a deeply domed polar sac, polaroplast consisting of closely packed longitudinally arranged membranes and loosely packed horizontally arranged membranes, and 10.5-14 coils of the polar tube in a single rank. The 16S rRNA genes of N. tyriae and Nosema bombycis from silkworms, Bombyx mori, differed by only six nucleotides and N. tyriae spores gave a moderately positive reaction with a monoclonal antibody raised to N. bombycis. N. tyriae was infective to B. mori but was less virulent than N. bombycis. However, no amplification product was obtained by PCR using N. tyriae DNA and primers considered to be specific for N. bombycis. Also, the spores of the two species are of entirely different shapes. A second diplokaryotic microsporidium, Nosema sp., found as a light infection in only one of the larvae had much smaller developmental stages and spores measuring 3.8 x 2.0 microm (fixed). Ultrastructurally it was distinguished by an abundance of dense membranes in cytoplasmic vesicles in both meronts and sporonts. Spores with up to 15 coils of the polar tube in irregular clusters or with about 12 coils in a single rank were observed in the tissues fixed from the one larva infected with this parasite. As this larva had been kept with N. tyriae-infected larvae for a few days before examination, it is possible that the two types of spores resulted from a double infection.",gut wall; silk gland; fat body; adipose tissue; systemic infection,gut wall; silk gland; fat body; adipose tissue; systemic infection,gut wall; silk gland; Adipose tissue; systemic infection,gut wall; Adipose tissue; larva,2,1,2
486,Nosema wistmansi,1,"The Taxonomy of Three Species of Microsporidia (Protozoa: Microspora) from an Oakwood Population of Winter Moths Operophtera Brumata (L.) (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) ::: Two species of stored product pests, Ptinus pusillus and P. Brunneus which were collected in watermills, and later reared in laboratory, became infected by two protozoan parasites, a coccidian Adelina tribolii comb. nov. And a microsporidian Nosema ptinidorum n. sp. Both parasites invade the fat body of adults of host-animals. The larvae remained free from infection. The two new pathogens are described and pictured. This is the first report on coccidian and microsporidian parasites found in stored product pests of the Family Ptinidae, Coleoptera.Three species of microsporidia from a population of winter moths, Operophtera brumata (L.), were examined by light microscopy. Pleistophora operophterae (Canning, 1960) is redescribed. The stages with one or two nuclei which were originally termed presporonts are now interpreted as fragments of disrupted vacuolated sporonts or prematuraly separated sporoblasts. The range of spore numbers within sporophorous vesicles is modified to 4 to c.60, rather than 10 to c.100. This species cannot be retained in the genus Pleistophora Gurley, 1893, redefined by Canning & Nicholas (1980), but ultrastructural studies are required before taxonomic reassignment is attempted. Nosema operophterae Canning, 1960 is also redescribed. Merogony consists mainly of binary fission of binucleate and tetranucleate stages but large irregular-shaped multinucleate meronts were also present. Ribbon-shaped sporonts with two, four or eight linearly-spaced nuclei give rise, via binucleate segments, to chains of uninucleate sporoblasts. The species is transferred to a new genus Orthosoma n.g. as Orthosoma operophterae (Canning, 1960) since its isolated nuclei and polysporoblastic sporogony are not characteristic of the genus Nosema Nägeli, 1857. The third species Nosema operophterae Purrini & Skatulla, 1979 is renamed N. wistmansi nom.nov. because the name given by Purrini & Skatulla was preoccupied and is now a synonym of O. operophterae. Details of the developmental stages of N. wistmansi are given, which show that it is typical of the genus Nosema, with nuclei in diplokaryon arrangement and with disporoblastic sporogony. All species are shown to have stages in the eggs of their hosts, which are thought to play a part in generation to generation transmission.",oocytes,oocytes,oocytes,watermills; fat body,0,2,1

(Microsporidia), parasite of enterocytes of Nothobranchius rubripinnis ::: A new intranuclear microsporidium, Nucleospora secunda n.sp., infecting intestinal epithelial cells of Nothobranchius rubripinnis Seegers, 1986, is described. Developmental stages and spores are isolated from one another in the karyoplasm. Merogony proceeds from simple uninucleate meronts to multinucleate meronts. Transformation into sporogonial plasmodia is marked by the appearance of ellipsoidal dark bodies, comparable to polar tube precursors, which later coalesce to form the turns of the polar tube. Primordia of the extrusion apparatus are already established in the plasmodium before it starts to cleave into separate sporoblasts. Ellipsoidal mature spores are of average size 1.6 x 0.8 m and have 4 to 5 turns of the polar tube. The polaroplast consists of an outer region of closely spaced lamellae, enclosing a region of widely spaced lamellae or loose flat cisternae.

Merogonial stages and sporonts are diplokaryotic. Sporogony comprises meiotic and mitotic divisions, and finally eight monokaryotic sporoblasts are released from a lobed plasmodium. Sporophorous vesicles are not formed. The monokaryotic spores are oval, measuring 1.4–1.8 × 2.8–3.4 μm in living condition. The thick spore wall has a layered exospore, with a median double‐layer. The polaroplast has two lamellar parts, with the closest packed lamellae anteriorly. The isofilar polar filament is arranged in 6 (to 7) coils in the posterior half of the spore. Laminar and tubular extracellular material of exospore construction is present in the proximity of sporogonial stages. In addition to normal spores teratological spores are produced. The microsporidium is compared to the microsporidia of the Odonata; its possible relations to the genus Pseudothelohania and to the Thelohania‐like microsporidia are discussed.

500,Oligosporidium occidentalis,1,"Morphological and molecular characterization of a new microsporidian species from the predatory mite Metaseiulus occidentalis (Nesbitt) (Acari, Phytoseiidae) ::: A new microsporidian species is described from the predatory mite Metaseiulus (formerly Typhlodromus or Galendromus) occidentalis (Nesbitt) (Acari, Phytoseiidae). The ultrastructure of this new species is presented together with the first molecular characterization for a microsporidium of mites. All stages of this new microsporidium are haplokaryotic and develop in direct contact with the host-cell cytoplasm. Sporogony is disporoblastic and spores are formed in eggs, immature stages, and adults of M. occidentalis. There are two morphological classes of spores, one with a short polar filament (3–5 coils) that measured m and one with a longer polar filament (8–9 coils) that measured m. Horizontal transmission of this new species occurs by cannibalism of eggs and other stages and perhaps involves the spores with the long polar filament. Spores with the short polar filament may play a role in autoinfection and vertical (transovarial) transmission that is highly efficient in transferring the microsporidium from adults to progeny. Analysis of the small subunit ribosomal DNA indicated that this species from M. occidentalis is most closely related to the Nosema/Vairimorpha clade of microsporidia. A conflict between the morphological and molecular data is discussed. The species is compared to previously described microsporidia of arachnids resulting in creation of Oligosporidium occidentalis n. sp. in the family Unikaryonidae. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.",egg; ovarian; intestinal; muscle; epithelium,egg; ovarian; intestinal; muscle; epithelium,muscle; intestinal; ovarian; egg; epithelium,Oligosporidium occidentalis n. sp.,0,1,5
501,Oogranate pervascens,1,"A New Genus Of Microsporidian Parasite (Hepatosporidae; Micro-Sporidia) Found In The Oocytes Of Ribbon Worms From The North Pacific Genus Maculaura (Heteronemertea; Nemertea) ::: An intracellular microsporidian parasite was first observed within oocytes of Maculaura alaskensis, a small pilidiophoran nemertean, commonly found on sandflats along the Pacific coast of North America. Infected oocytes have large vesicles containing dozens to hundreds of diplokaryotic, ellipsoid spores measuring 1.3 by 2.3 µm. A partial small subunit nuclear ribosomal 18S gene sequence isolated from the microsporidian does not match any known microsporidian sequences in the public databases. Phylogenetic analysis groups it with Hepatospora eriocheir in a sister clade to the Enterocytozoonidae. All the known life stages of this parasite are contained within a membranous envelope. This microsporidian was identified in M. alaskensis, Maculaura aquilonia, Maculaura oregonensis, and Maculaura cerebrosa in Coos Bay, Oregon, in M. alaskensis from Newport, Oregon, and in M. aquilonia collected in Juneau, Alaska.

The parasite infects the musculature of the pink shrimp Pandalus montagui captured from United Kingdom waters. The novel microsporidium is morphologically and phylogenetically dissimilar to its nearest phylogenetic branch relative Thelohania butleri infecting the sister shrimp taxon Pandalus jordani. Furthermore, it is morphologically distinct from the type species of the genus Thelohania, Thelohania giardi infecting European brown shrimp Crangon crangon. Since phylogenetic data pertaining to type T. giardi is not currently available, our discovery places some doubt on the likelihood that T. butleri represents the proposed surrogate for the type taxon. Further it demonstrates potential for significant morphological plasticity in this clade of muscle-infecting microsporidians of crustaceans which contains the genera Myospora, Cucumispora, Thelohania, and now Paradoxium. Since it cannot be stated with certainty that T. butleri (or other taxa within the clade) represent true close relatives of T. giardi, clarity on this issue will only occur with re-discovery and genotyping of type T. giardi infecting C. crangon from European waters.",skeletal musculature; heart myofibres; longitudinal and circular muscles surrounding the gut,skeletal musculature; heart myofibres; longitudinal and circular muscles surrounding the gut,Set of muscles; gut; heart myofibres,Set of muscles,1,0,2

The crab was sampled from within its invasive range in Atlantic Canada (Nova Scotia). Histopathology and transmission electron microscopy were used to show the development of the parasite within a simple interfacial membrane, culminating in the formation of unikaryotic spores with 5–6 turns of an isofilar polar filament. Formation of a multinucleate meront (>12 nuclei observed) preceded thickening and invagination of the plasmodial membrane, and in many cases, formation of spore extrusion precursors (polar filaments, anchoring disk) prior to complete separation of pre-sporoblasts from the sporogonial plasmodium. This developmental feature is intermediate between the Enterocytozoonidae (formation of spore extrusion precursors within the sporont plasmodium) and all other Microsporidia (formation of spore extrusion precursors after separation of sporont from the sporont plasmodium). SSU rRNA-based gene phylogenies place P. carcini within microsporidian Clade IV, between the Enterocytozoonidae and the so-called Enterocytospora-clade, which includes Enterocytospora artemiae and Globulispora mitoportans. Both of these groups contain gut-infecting microsporidians of aquatic invertebrates, fish and humans. According to morphological and phylogenetic characters, we propose that P. carcini occupies a basal position to the Enterocytozoonidae.

The larvae were maintained under laboratory conditions in salt concentrations of 10 g/l and 20 g/l of water. Daily recordings of the mortality of the larvae were made and the dates of change of instar were noted. Infected larvae were processed for transmission electronic microscopy using conventional methods at pH 7.2 and 260 mOsm/l. The infection by the microsporidia was positively correlated with an increase in the mean duration of the fourth instar of 2.88 to 6.33 days in 10 g/l of salt and of 2.47 to 6.14 days in 20 g/l of salt. Larval mortality also increased by approximately 50% during this instar in both salt concentrations. Development time and survival were not affected during the other immature stages. The mature spores found in the intestines of infected larvae were barrel shaped and measured approximately 2.6 x 2.4 mm. The exospore has a collar shaped prolongation at the posterior end of the spore. The spores are uninuclear with a posterior vacuole. The polar filament is anisofilar with nine rings, five with a diameter of 58 nm each and four with a diameter of 23 nm each. The polarplast is lamellate, and more tightly packed in the apical region. The reduction of the survival of A. aquasalis larvae infected with the microsporidia, and the increase in the development time suggest that this parasite might have a potential as a biological control of this pest. The microsporidium described here has similar characteristics to that of the genus Parathelohania.

The spores of Pe. moriokae had an average size of 1.0 × 3.8 µm and 1.3 × 3.2 µm in the intestine and hypodermis, respectively, and electron microscopy revealed that they exhibited distinguishing features with morphological diversity in the hypodermis. Isolated spores were able to infect a reference strain of O. tipulae (CEW1) through horizontal transmission but not the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Upon infection, the spores were first observed in the hypodermis and then in the intestine the following day, suggesting a unique infectious route among nematode-infective microsporidia. Molecular phylogenetic analysis grouped this new species with the recently identified nematode-infective parasites Enteropsectra and Pancytospora forming a monophyletic sister clade to Orthosomella in clade IV, which also includes human pathogens such as Enterocytozoon and Vittaforma.

PARASITOS EN SIMULIDOS DE LOS ANDES COLOMBIANOS ::: We describe the ultrastructure of two microsporidia parasites of simuliids of the region of La Calera (2.950 m alt.), near Bogotá. Polydispyrenia simulii was found infecting larvae of Simulium ignescens and Polydispyrenia norandina sp. nov., infecting a larva of Gigantodax ortizi. The two species present large number of spores aggregated within a sporophoric vesicle, characteristic of the family Pleistophoridae. Polydispyrenia simulii, a cosmopolitan parasite of simuliid larvae, has until now been the only known species of this genus. Two ultrastructural characters permit identification of this species: a) Presence of peculiar cylindrical structures surrounding the sporoblasts in the cavity of the sporophoric vesicle (episporontal space); in cross section these structures look like thick-walled rings: b) Consistently 5-6 coils of the polar filament inside the mature spore.

(Microsporidia, Tetramicridae), a parasite infecting the freshwater fish Aequidens plagiozonatus (Teleostei, Cichlidae) from Brazil ::: Morphological and molecular procedures were used to describe a new species of microsporidian that infects the muscles of the sub-opercular region and the caudal fins of the freshwater Aequidens plagiozonatus in Brazil. This microsporidian forms whitish xenomas containing variable number of spores, reaching up to ~0.4 mm in diameter. The mature spores, pyriformin shape, with slightly round ends, measured 3.4 ± 0.5 μm long and 1.9 ± 0.3 μm wide (n = 50) and showed characteristics typical of Microsporidia. The average thickness of the spore wall was 100 (96–108) nm (n = 50), and the spore wall was composed of two layers, a thin, electron-dense exospore and a thick electron-transparent endospore. The exospore was surrounded by a thin, irregular layer of granular material. The anchoring disc was mushroom-like, located in the apical region of the spore in an eccentric position relative to the spore axis, rendering bilateral asymmetry to the spore. The anterior part of the polar filament (PF) (manubrium) measured approximately 125 (122–128) nm thick (n = 30), and the angle of tilt between the anterior PF and the spore axis was ~45°; the posterior part was packed in 8–9 coils. Phylogenetic analysis showed a strongly supported clade containing family Spragueidae Weissenberg, 1976, family Tetramicridae Matthews and Matthews, 1980, Microsporidium sp. RBS1, and Kabatana spp. In conclusion, the available morphological, ultrastructural, and molecular data shows that this microsporidian is a new species belonging to group 4, classified as Potaspora aequidens n. sp.

571,Potaspora macrobrachium,1,"A new microsporidium, Potaspora macrobrachium n.sp. infecting the musculature of pond-reared oriental river prawn Macrobrachium nipponense (Decapoda: Palaemonidae) ::: This paper described a novel microsporidian infection in the pond-reared oriental river prawn Macrobrachium nipponense. A conspicuous symptom of the infection was progressive white opacity associated with the musculature. Although neither bacteria nor viruses were detected in routine diagnostic tests, apparently degenerated microsporidian cells or spores were frequently observed in wet smears of the musculature from diseased prawns. Histological observations also revealed characteristics typical of microsporidian infection throughout the host. Transmission electron microscopy revealed multiple life stages of a microsporidian parasite within the cytoplasm of host muscle cells. In addition, partial small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene was obtained by a nested PCR using microsporidian specific primers. A consensus sequence was then deposited in GenBank (accession no. KU307278) and subjected to a general BLASTn search that yielded hits only for microsporidian sequence records. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolate was most similar to the fish microsporidian clade containing the genera Kabatana, Microgemma, Potaspora, Spraguea, and Teramicra. The highest sequence identity, 87%, was with Potaspora spp. Based on histological, ultrastructure and molecular phylogenetic data, we erected a new species, Potaspora macrobrachium for the novel microsporidium.

This microsporidian forms whitish xenomas distinguished by the numerous filiform and anastomosed microvilli. The xenoma was completely filled by several developmental stages. In all of these stages, the nuclei are monokaryotic and develop in direct contact with host cell cytoplasm. The merogonial plasmodium divides by binary fission and the disporoblastic pyriform spores of sporont origin measure 2·8±0·3×1·5±0·2 μm. In mature spores the polar filament was arranged into 9–10 coils in 2 layers. The polaroplast had 2 distinct regions around the manubrium and an electron-dense globule was observed. The small subunit, intergenic space and partial large subunit rRNA gene were sequenced and maximum parsimony analysis placed the microsporidian described here in the clade that includes the genera Kabatana, Microgemma, Spraguea and Tetramicra. The ultrastructural morphology of the xenoma, and the developmental stages including the spores of this microsporidian parasite, as well as the phylogenetic analysis, suggest the erection of a new genus and species.",intestinal,intestinal,intestinal,coelomic cavity; wall,0,2,1

The parasite elicits formation of spherical xenomas of up to 1.2 mm in diameter containing all observed life stages from early merogonal plasmodia to mature spores contained within the cytoplasm of host hepatocytes. Merogonal plasmodia existed in direct contact with the host cytoplasm and contained up to 20 visible nuclei. Plasmotomy of the multinucleate plasmodium led to formation of uninucleate cells in which the nucleus underwent further division to form bi-nucleate presporonts, sporonts (defined by cells with a thickened endospore) and eventually sporoblasts (containing pre-cursors of the spore extrusion apparatus). Mature spores were pyriform and monokaryotic, measuring 2.3 ± 0.19 μm long and 1.3 ± 0.10 μm wide. Spores possessed a bipartite polaroplast and 5–6 coils of a polar filament, in a single rank. The obtained partial SSU rRNA gene sequence, 1383 bp in length, did not match any of microsporidia available in GenBank. SSU rDNA-based phylogenetic analysis indicated a new taxon branching with Kabatana rondoni, a parasite infecting the skeletal muscle of Gymnorhamphichthys rondoni from the Amazon River. Due to different host and tissue tropism, the novel taxon did not fit the diagnostic criteria for the genus Kabatana. Further, based on SSU rDNA-inferred phylogenetic analyses, different ultrastructural features of developmental stages, and ecological considerations, a new genus Pseudokabatana and type species Pseudokabatana alburnus n. sp. was erected for the parasite in topmouth culter.",Hepatocytes of Liver,Hepatocytes of Liver,Hepatocytes,liver; skeletal muscle,0,2,1
575,Pseudoloma neurophilia,1,"Pseudoloma neurophilia n. g., n. sp., a new microsporidium from the central nervous system of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) ::: An unusual xenoma-forming microsporidium was discovered in the central nervous system of moribund zebrafish from a laboratory colony in Eugene, Oregon. Infected fish were often emaciated and lethargic, and histological examination commonly revealed severe myelitis and myositis associated with the infection. Based on its structure, development, and small subunit ribosomal DNA sequence it is unique among fish microsporidia. Spores are uninucleate, ovoid to pyriform, with a prominent posterior vacuole. Spores average 5.4 × 2.7 μm with 13-16 coils of the polar filament. The microsporidium produces xenomas within the spinal cord and hindbrain of fish, and xenomas contained sporophorous vesicles with up to 16 spores. Sporoblasts and presporoblast stages (probably sporonts) are found occasionally in small aggregates dispersed randomly throughout xenomas. It clustered in the ""Ichthyosporidium group"" along with other fish microsporidian genera based on rDNA sequence analysis. The rDNA sequence of the zebrafish microsporidium was most similar to that of Ichthyosporidium, but showed only 12.1% similarity and therefore this microsporidium can be considered a distinct genus and species, which we have named Pseudoloma neurophilia n. g., n. sp.",nervous,nervous,nervous,sporonts,0,1,1

Merogonial and sporogonial stages are diplokaryotic. Sporogony is disporoblastic. The spores are cylindrical, often slightly curved and wider in the mid-region, 1.8–2.1 × 8.1–14.2 um long in fixed and stained condition. The spore wall has a ca. 43 mm thick, uniform exospore. The polaroplast has an anterior part with compressed lamellae and a posterior section with 53–128 nm wide tubules. The polar filament has a 181–283 nm wide, straight, short, anterior section in the centre of the spore, an oblique section with tapering diameter, and a long, posterior, 119–178 nm wide section, arranged in (10−)12(−13) isofilar coils, close to the spore wall in the posterior half of the spore. The most anterior and most posterior coils are irregularly arranged, the median coils form a close, regular group. The angle of tilt of the most anterior, regularly arranged coil is ca. 55°. The transversely sectioned filament has distinct concentrical layers of variable thickness and electron density. The diplokaryon occupies the centre of the spore. Sporophorous vesicle absent, but a folded, ca. 16 nm thick envelope, resembling a sporophorous vesicle, is formed by delamination of exospore material. Teratological sporogony was observed. The microsporidium is compared to microsporidia of the genera Bacillidium, Jirovecia and Hrabyeia.

(Bryozoa: Phylactolaemata) ::: Abstract. The development of a new species of microsporidian, infecting a freshwater Plumatellid bryozoan, is described. The small-subunit rDNA, internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), and partial large-subunit rDNA genes were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the parasite clustered with Schroedera plumatellae. However, while there were morphological affinities with this species, significant differences were also observed. The infection initially appeared as a roughening of the peritoneum lining the metacoelom of the bryozoan. This roughening resolved into meront-infected syncytia, composed of interconnected cells of the body wall that detached to float in the coleomic cavity. Spores were observed to develop within these syncytia. All stages of development were diplokaryotic in contrast to S. plumatellae, which has a distinct monokaryotic merogony preceding sporogony. The infection was pathogenic to the host. Direct bryozoan–bryozoan transmission was not observed.

582,Sporanauta perivermis,1,"Microsporidian Infection in a Free-Living Marine Nematode ::: Microsporidia are unicellular fungi that are obligate endoparasites. Although nematodes are one of the most abundant and diverse animal groups, the only confirmed report of microsporidian infection was that of the “nematode killer” (Nematocida parisii). N. parisii was isolated from a wild Caenorhabditis sp. and causes an acute and lethal intestinal infection in a lab strain of Caenorhabditis elegans. We set out to characterize a microsporidian infection in a wild nematode to determine whether the infection pattern of N. parisii in the lab is typical of microsporidian infections in nematodes. We describe a novel microsporidian species named Sporanauta perivermis (marine spore of roundworms) and characterize its infection in its natural host, the free-living marine nematode Odontophora rectangula. S. perivermis is not closely related to N. parisii and differs strikingly in all aspects of infection. Examination by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the infection was localized in the hypodermal and muscle tissues only and did not involve the intestines. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed infection in the muscle and hypodermis, and surprisingly, it also revealed that the parasite infects O. rectangula eggs, suggesting a vertical mode of transmission. Our observations highlight the importance of studying parasites in their natural hosts and indicate that not all nematode-infecting microsporidia are “nematode killers”; instead, microsporidiosis can be more versatile and chronic in the wild.",Hypoderm (adults); muscles (adults); egg (adult female); and the reproductive tissues of juveniles,Hypoderm; muscles; egg; and the reproductive tissues of juveniles,tissues; Hypoderm; egg; muscles,spore; Hypoderm; muscle,1,2,3
586,Takaokaspora nipponicus,1,"Morphological and molecular characterization of a microsporidian parasite, Takaokaspora nipponicus n. gen., n. sp. from the invasive rock pool mosquito, Ochlerotatus japonicus japonicus ::: Graphical abstract Highlights • A new genus and species of Microsporidia is described from mosquitoes. • The microsporidium is vertically and horizontally transmitted and exhibits dimorphic development. • Development in vertically-infected larvae is fatal and results in the formation of uninucleate conical spores. • Horizontal transmission occurs via oral ingestion of spores produced in vertically-infected larvae. • The SSU rDNA sequence of the microsporidium is unique from all other mosquito-parasitic species. Abstract A new genus and species of Microsporidia, Takaokaspora nipponicus n. gen., n. sp. is described from Ochlerotatus japonicus japonicus (Theobald) and Ochlerotatus hatorii (Yamada) based on light microscope and ultrastructural morphology, developmental features, transmission cycles and comparative sequence analyses of the small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA). The microsporidium is both vertically and horizontally transmitted, exhibits dimorphic development alternating between diplokaryotic and monokaryotic stages and produces two morphologically distinct spores, one in larvae and another in adult females. Horizontal transmission of infection to larval mosquitoes occurs via direct oral ingestion of uninucleate spores that are produced in vertically-infected larval hosts. Development in horizontally-infected hosts is diplokaryotic following karyokinesis of uninucleate schizonts and binary fission to produce small (4.3μm×2.0μm) membrane free, ovoid, binucleate spores that are confined to adult female reproductive tissues (ovariole sheath and oviducts). Vertical transmission of the microsporidium from adult females to larval progeny takes place via surface contamination of the egg (transovum). Microsporidian development in vertically-infected larvae is haplophasic with unpaired nuclei throughout, producing rosette-shaped sporogonial plasmodia contained within a thin non-persistent sporophorous vesicle and culminating in the formation of membrane free, uninucleate, conical spores (7.0μm×2.8μm). Development is confined to host fat body tissue which appears as swollen white masses in the thorax and selected segments of the abdomen causing larvae to appear abnormally distorted and results in death during the third and fourth instar stages. The SSU rDNA sequences obtained from the two morphologically identical microsporidia isolated from Oc. j. japonicus and Oc. hatorii were nearly identical and unique when compared with GenBank entries of all other mosquito-parasitic species. Phylogenetic trees constructed by Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and bootstrap analyses using the Neighbor Joining search parameter yielded similar typologies. In each case, the novel microsporidium was the sister group to the clade containing Parathelohania species from Anopheles mosquitoes and the monotypic Novothelohania ovalae from Ochlerotatus caspius showing approximately 10–13% sequence divergence to those two genera providing strong support for establishment as a separate genus.",adipose of larvae (vertical trans.); gonads (of horizontally-infected adult female hosts),adipose of larvae; gonads,gonads; Adipose tissue,thorax; abdomen; Adipose tissue; ribosomal DNA,1,3,1

The fine structure of the HMY was found to be similar to that of Trachipleistophora hominis Hollister, Canning, Weldner, Field, Kench et Marriott, 1996. Characteristic is the presence of a thick layer of electron dense material on the outer face of the meront plasmalemma, which is maintained during the whole life cycle and which later persists as an electron dense coat on the sporophorous vesicle (SPOV). However, HMY is distinguished from T. hominis during sporogony, as two types of SPOV and spores are formed in HMY. One type of SPOV contains thick-walled spores (usually 8 or more in number) with anisofilar polar filaments of 7 + 2 pattern, while the other type contains only two thin-walled spores with a smaller number (3-5) of isofilar polar filament coils. The HMY differs from T. apodemi which also forms SPOV with 8 spores inside, but the spores of which are larger in size and have 9 + 2 polar filament pattern.",brain; kidney,brain; kidney,brain; kidney,Am.,0,1,2

Spores were diplokaryotic with a thin spore wall and a short polar filament, characteristics typical of 'early' spores involved in autoinfection. The diplokaryotic life-cycle, absence of spore groupings and of a pansporoblast membrane typify the genus Nosema. However, the unusual globular polaroplast of the spore and restriction of this stage to host ovarian tissue, have not previously been described in Nosema. Sporogony occurred only in follicle cells adjacent to developing oocytes and was in synchrony with the process of vitellogenesis. Oocytes were infected after formation of intracellular connections with follicle cells but harboured only vegetative stages of the parasite. Parasites were associated with the perinuclear cytoplasm and, in developing embryos, segregated to daughter cells along the axis of the spindle. In juvenile animals there was no evidence of pathology linked with feminization and the parasite was found at low density in cells under the cuticle.

Vairimorpha cheracis sp. nov. was found in a highland population of the Australian freshwater crayfish, Cherax destructor. The majority of spores and earlier developmental stages of V. cheracis sp. nov. were found within striated muscle cells of the thorax, abdomen, and appendages of the crayfish. Only octosporoblastic sporogony within sporophorous vesicles (SPVs) was observed. Diplokaryotic sporonts separated into two uninucleate daughter cells, each of which gave rise to four sporoblasts in a rosette-shaped plasmodium, so that eight uninucleate spores were produced within the persistent ovoid SPV. Ultrastructural features of stages in the octosporoblastic sequence were similar to those described for Vairimorpha necatrix, the type species. Mature spores were pyriform in shape and averaged 3.4×1.9μm in dimensions. The anterior polaroplast was lamellar in structure, and the posterior polaroplast vesicular. The polar filament was coiled 10–12 times, lateral to the posterior vacuole. The small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) of V. cheracis sp. nov. was sequenced and compared with other microsporidia. V. cheracis sp. nov. showed over 97% sequence identity with Vairimorpha imperfecta and five species of Nosema, and only 86% sequence identity with V. necatrix.

Abstract Vairimorpha sp. BM (2012) is a recent isolate of the microsporidia from the silkworm in Shandong, China. The ultrastructure, tissue pathology and molecular characterization of this isolate is described in this study. This pathogenic fungus causes pebrine disease in silkworms which manifests as a systemic infection. Meanwhile, the silkworm eggs produced by the infected moths were examined using a microscope and PCR amplification. Neither spores nor the expected PCR band were observed, suggesting that no vertical transmission occurred in Bombyx mori. In addition, the ultrastructure of the isolate was studied by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Two types of spores were observed: diplokaroytic spores with 13–17 coils of polar tubes and monokaryotic spores with less coils of polar tubes which could form octospores; however, no sporophorous vesicles were observed. Finally, phylogenetic analysis of the small subunit rRNA genes of Vairimorpha species showed that this isolate has a closer relationship to Vairimorpha necatrix than the other species studied. This result also is supported by phylogenetic analysis based on their actin genes, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and RNA polymerase II (RPB1).

The microsporidian infection had little impact on the fitness of this lepidopteran pest. However, when Trichogramma chilonis parasitized such infected host eggs, the offspring of this parasitoid species suffered from severe deficiencies. Microsporidian spores, ingested by parasitoid larvae together with the host egg nutrients, gave rise to stages which developed in various tissues of the parasitoid, such as the flight muscle and the nervous system. This infection resulted in a significantly increased rate of metamorphosis failure (related to host age) and reduced longevity and reproductive performance of the parasitoids. There are two main consequences arising from our findings if T. chilonis is to be used in an integrated control strategy against P. xylostella: (1) T. chilonis must be raised on Vairimorpha-free host eggs to receive viable and efficaceous parasitoids for release and (2) if natural populations of the cabbage moth in cruciferous crops are infected with Vairimorpha to a significant extent, the parasitoid must be released repeatedly within infested crop areas.",flight muscles; nervous system; egg,flight muscles; nervous system; egg,egg; flight muscles; nervous system,cabbage moth; Plutella xylostella,0,2,3

Developmental stages of Zelenkaia spp. have single nuclei. In sporogony, a plasmodium with four nuclei gives rise by rosette-like budding to two pairs of uninucleate sporoblasts, each within a thin-walled, subpersistent sporophorous vesicle. Sporoblasts and mature spores adhere temporary together, forming doublets oriented in parallel, within the sporophorous vesicle. Spores are long-oval and uninucleate, and those of the type species Z. trichopterae measure 10.3×3.5μm and have 24–25 polar filament coils. Phylogenetic analysis based on rDNA places Zelenkaia spp. within the aquatic clade of microsporidia and, more specifically, in the clade containing some microporidia from amphipod hosts.",Adipose,Adipose,Adipose,fat body tissues; rDNA; spore doublets,0,3,1
