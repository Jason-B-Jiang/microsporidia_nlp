3,Agglomerata cladocera (siberian isolate),1,"Microsporidia Alfvenia sibirica sp. n. and Agglomerata cladocera (Pfeiffer) 1895, from Siberian microcrustaceans and phylogenetic relationships within the “Aquatic outgroup” lineage of fresh water microsporidia ::: Here we report on two microsporidia from freshwater crustaceans collected during the ongoing survey for microsporidia in the river Karasuk and adjacent waterbodies (Novosibirsk region, Western Siberia). The first species parasitized hypoderm and fat body of a cyclopid Cyclops sp. (Maxillopoda, Copedoda) and produced oval spores, measured 2.0×3.6μm (fixed) enclosed individually or in small groups in fragile sporophorous vesicles (SVs). We describe it here as Alfvenia sibirica sp. n. The second species infected the same tissues of a cladoceran Daphnia magna (Branchiopoda, Phyllopoda). Its spores were pyriform, 2.3×4.0μm (fixed), and resided in relatively persistent SVs in groups of 8–16. This species was identified as a Siberian isolate (Si) of Agglomerata cladocera (Pfeifer) because ultrastructurally it was hardly distinguishable from A. cladocera recorded from England from the same host (Larsson et al., 1996). A. cladocera (Si) shared 99% SSU rDNA sequence similarity to Binucleata daphniae from D. magna collected in Belgium (Refardt et al., 2008). The major outcome of our work is that we present molecular (SSUrDNA) characterization coupled with EM description, for representatives of two genera, Alfvenia (encompasses 3 described so far species) and Agglomerata (7 species), which allowed us to place these two genera on the phylogenetic tree. We also summarized the literature data on Alfvenia and Agglomerata spp., and provided their comparative morphological analysis. These two genera belong to so called “Aquatic outgroup” (Vossbrinck et al., 2004), a poorly resolved lineage, a sister to Amblyosporidae. This lineage probably includes majority of fresh water forms of microsporidia, most of which remain undescribed. SSUrDNA-based phylogenetic analysis and analysis of hosts suggest that diversification within the “Aquatic outgroup” could have been connected with the host switch from dipterans or copepods to cladocerans that had occurred in some ancestral Amblyospora-related lineage(s).",Hypoderm; adipose,Hypoderm; adipose,Adipose tissue; Hypoderm,cladoceran Daphnia; SVs; Adipose tissue; Hypoderm,2,2,0
5,Agglomerata daphnia,1,"Morphological and molecular characterization of a new species, Agglomerata daphniae n. sp. from the hypoderm of Daphnia magna (Crustacea: Daphniidae) ::: A new microsporidian species was described from the hypoderm of Daphnia magna sampled from gibel carp (Carassius auratus gibelio) ponds located in Wuhan city, China. The infected cladocerans generally appeared opaque due to numerous plasmodia distributed in the host integument. The earliest stages observed were uninucleate meronts that were in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm. Meronts developed into multinucleate sporogonial plasmodia enclosed in sporophorous vesicles. Sporoblasts were produced by the rosette-like division of sporogonial division. Mature spores were pyriform and monokaryotic, measuring 4.48 ± 0.09 (4.34-4.65) µm long and 2.40 ± 0.08 (2.18-2.54) µm wide. The polaroplast was bipartite with loose anterior lamellae and tight posterior lamellae. Polar filaments, arranged in two rows, were anisofilar with two wider anterior coils, and five narrower posterior coils. The exospore was covered with fibrous secretions and was composed of four layers. Phylogenetic analysis based on the obtained SSU rDNA sequence, indicated that the present species clustered with three unidentified Daphnia pulicaria-infecting microsporidia with high support values to form a monophyletic lineage, rather than with the congener, Agglomerata cladocera. The barcode motif of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the novel species was unique among representatives of the ""Agglomeratidae"" sensu clade (Vávra et al., 2018). Based on the morphological characters and SSU rDNA-inferred phylogenetic analyses, a new species was erected and named as Agglomerata daphniae n. sp.

6,Agglomerata lacrima,1,"Ultrastructure and light microscopic cytology of Agglomerata lacrima n. sp. (Microspora, Duboscqiidae), a microsporidian parasite of Acanthocyclops vernalis (Copepoda, Cyclopidae) ::: Agglomerata lacrima n. sp. is the first species of the genus described from a copepod host (Acanthocyclops vernalis.) It was studied using light- and electron-microscopy. All stages of the life-cycle had isolated nuclei. The earliest stages found were uninucleate merozoites. Sporogony produced 4-12 (mostly 8) pyriform spores by rosette-like budding within a fragile sporophorous vesicle. Live spores measured 4.4 +/- 0.2 x 2.6 +/- 0.2 μm, and fixed spores measured 3.7 +/- 0.2 x 1.6 +/- 0.2 μm. The exospore was constructed of 4 layers. The anisofilar polar filament made 5-6 coils in the posterior half of the spore. The polaroplast had an anterior part with wide lamellae (chambers), followed by a second zone of narrow lamellae. Tubule-like structures which might constitute a third polaroplast region were present immediately anterior to the first filament coil. Cytological characteristics and the generic position of the species are discussed, and it is compared to related or resembling species, and to all previously reported microsporidian species from copepods.",hypodermal; adipose,hypodermal; adipose,hypodermal; adipose,merozoites,0,1,2

(Microsporea:Glugeidae), a microsporidian of Bufo marinus tadpoles and metamorphosing toads (Amphibia:Anura) from Amazonian Brazil ::: A microsporidian infection, due to Alloglugea bufonis nov. gen., nov. sp., is described in the tadpoles and newly metamorphosed toads of Bufo marinus from a lake near Belem, Para, north Brazil. Xenomas occur either singly in the lamina propria of the intestine, or aggregated into cystic bodies of up to 0.2 mm diameter, which emerge above the intestine surface. The xenoma is bounded by a folded plasmalemma with pinocytotic depressions, and there is a central, enlarged nucleus. Plasmodial stages and elongate meronts differentiate ~ n t o ribbon-shaped sporonts and single-nucleated sporo- blasts. The spore cytoplasm is invaginated at the posterior end. Spores escape from the mature xeno- mas into reticuloendothelial cells of the liver, spleen and kidneys of the tadpoles and newly metamorphosed toads, but infection is gradually lost after metamorphosis.","intestines (lamina propria); liver (reticuloendothelial cells, blood vessels); spleen (primary infection site); kidney (glomeruli, primary infection site); macrophages; phagocytes",intestines; lamina propria; liver; reticuloendothelial cells; blood vessels; spleen; kidney; glomeruli; macrophages; phagocytes,blood vessels; kidney; phagocytes; lamina propria; reticuloendothelial cells; liver; macrophages; glomeruli; intestines; spleen,tadpoles,0,1,10
13,Amazonspora hassar,1,"Amazonspora hassar n. gen. and n. sp. (Phylum Microsporidia, fam. Glugeidae), a parasite of the Amazonian teleost Hassar orestis (fam. Doradidae) ::: We describe the microsporidian Amazonspora hassar n. gen., n. sp. from the gill xenomas of the teleost Hassar orestis (Doradidae) collected in the estuarine region of the Amazon River. The parasite appeared as a small whitish xenoma located in the gill filaments near the blood vessels. Each xenoma consisted of a single hypertrophic host cell (HHC) in the cytoplasm of which the microsporidian developed and proliferated. The xenoma wall was composed of up to approximately 22 juxtaposed crossed layers of collagen fibers. The plasmalemma of the HHC presented numerous anastomosed, microvilli-like structures projecting outward through the 1-3 first internal layers of the collagen fibrils. The parasite was in direct contact with host cell cytoplasm in all stages of the cycle (merogony and sporogony). Sporogony appears to divide by plasmotomy, giving rise to 4 uninucleate sporoblasts, which develop into uninucleate spores. The ellipsoidal spores measured 2.69 ± 0.45 × 1.78 ± 0.18 μm, and the wall measured ∼75 nm. The anchoring disk of the polar filament was subterminal, being shifted laterally from the anterior pole. The polar filament was arranged into 7-8 coils in a single layer in the posterior half of the spore, surrounding the posterior vacuole. The polaroplast surrounded the uncoiled portion of the polar filament, and it was exclusively lamellar. The spores and different life-cycle stages were intermingled within the cytoplasm of the HHC, surrounding the central hypertrophic deeply branched nucleus. The ultrastructural morphology of this microsporidian parasite suggests the erection of a new genus and species.",gills,gills,gills,blood vessels; gill xenomas; gill filaments,0,3,1

(Microsporidia: Amblyosporidae) in the mosquito Culex renatoi (Diptera, Culicidae) and the copepod Paracyclops fimbriatus fimbriatus (Copepoda, Cyclopidae) ::: The life cycle of Amblyospora camposi n. sp. is described from the mosquito Culex renatoi and the copepod Paracyclops fimbriatus fimbriatus collected in the leaf axils of the plant Eryngium cabrerae in Argentina. Meiospores of A. camposi (5.8 x 4.1 μm) were infectious per os to female adults of the copepod P. f. fimbriatus. All developmental stages in the copepod had unpaired nuclei, with sporulation involving the formation of a sub-persistent, sporontogenic, interfacial envelope and the production of a second type of uninucleate spore. These spores, formed in the ovaries of P. f. fimbriatus, were large, pyriform, and measured 10.70 x 3.85 μm. When ingested they infected C. renatoi larvae to initiate a sequence that involves schizogony and gametogony and ends with plasmogamy and nuclear association to form diplokaryotic meronts. Oblong ovate binucleate spores (7.86 x 2.96 μm) are formed in the adult mosquito and are responsible for vertical transmission to the filial generation.

37,Amblyospora egypti,1,"A light- and electron-microscopic study of Amblyospora egypti n.sp. infecting Culex pipiens in Egypt ::: A microsporidium was found infecting the fat body of larvae and adults of both sexes of Culex pipiens in Egypt. Developmental stages were found in larvae but only masses of spores were present in adults. The infection was easily visible in live mosquito larvae, as one or two blocks of opaque whitish fat body visible through the cuticle in each segment. Meronts were rounded cells, which were bounded by an unthickened unit membrane and divided by binary fission (rarely into four). At the onset of sporogony the surface membrane was thickened by electron dense deposits. This coat was sloughed off to form the sporophorous vesicle, the separation from the sporont surface being effected by the secretion of metabolic products into the sporophorous vesicle cavity. Division within the vesicle gave rise to eight uninucleate sporoblasts, then uninucleate spores. Spores exhibited an exospore of two membrane-like layers and a subtending layer of moderate electron density, appearing as eight to ten strata separated by fine lines and permeated by amorphous material, and an electron lucent endospore. The polar tube was anisofilar with 3–4 broad coils and 4–3 narrow coils. The development and spore structure were in accord with the genus Amblyospora Hazard and Oldacre, 1975 and, on the basis of spore size and number of coils of the polar tube, it is considered to be a new species, Amblyospora egypti n.sp.",fat body,fat body,fat body,membrane-like layers; fine lines; fat body; layer,1,3,0

The parasite is transovarially transmitted for one generation only. Spores in adult females extrude binucleate sporoplasms which infect developing eggs. Merogony occurs in larval oenocytes with diplokaryotic stages in early instars giving rise to plasmodia with many diplokarya. Plasmodia undergo cytokinesis to form diplokaryotic sporonts. In fat body cells, these sporonts secrete pansporoblastic membranes and undergo two nuclear divisions to form octonucleate sporonts. Cytokinesis and differentiation result in uninucleate spores in packets of eight. These spores are not transmissible per os and are of different morphotype from those in adult females.

This species was found to be heterosporous with two concurrent sporulation sequences in the host larvae, both arising from diplokaryotic meronts and ending with haploid spores. One sequence was dominant and involved meiosis to produce eight thick‐walled, broadly oval meiospores in a sporophorous vesicle (SV). The other sequence involved nuclear dissociation to produce lanceolate, thin‐walled spores in a subpersistent SV. Horizontal transmission to the mosquito host, by one or both of two distinctly different pathways (one via an intermediate host, the other by cannibalism of infected individuals) and by vertical transmission, are postulated but have not been demonstrated.

In 2007-2008, a rare microsporidian parasite with spore characteristics typical of the Ameson genus was detected in 2 spiny lobsters from southeast Florida (FL). However, the parasite species was not confirmed by molecular analyses. To address this deficiency, reported here are structural and molecular data on single lobsters displaying comparable ‘cotton-like’ abdominal muscle containing ovoid microsporidian spores found at different locations in FL in 2014 and 2018 and in Saint Kitts and Nevis Islands in 2017. In the lobster from 2014, multiple life stages consistent with an Ameson-like monokaryotic microsporidian were detected by transmission electron microscopy. A partial (1228 bp) small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene sequence showed each microsporidia to be identical and positioned it closest phylogenetically to Ameson pulvis in a highly supported clade also containing A. michaelis, A. metacarcini, A. portunus, and Nadelspora canceri.

(Microsporidia) infecting the muscles of Dungeness crabs Metacarcinus magister from British Columbia, Canada ::: The Dungeness crab Metacarcinus magister supports a large and valuable fishery along the west coast of North America. Since 1998, Dungeness crabs exhibiting pink- to orange-colored joints and opaque white musculature have been sporadically observed in low prevalence from the Fraser River delta of British Columbia, Canada. We provide histological, ultrastructural, and molecular evidence that this condition is caused by a new microsporidian parasite. Crabs displaying gross symptoms were confirmed to have heavy infections of ovoid-shaped microsporidian spores (~1.8 × 1.4 µm in size) within muscle bundles of the skeletal musculature. The parasite apparently infected the outer periphery of each muscle bundle, and then proliferated into the muscle fibres near the centre of each infected bundle. Light infections were observed in heart tissues, and occasionally spores were observed within the fixed phagocytes lining the blood vessels of the hepatopancreas. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed multiple life stages of a monokaryotic microsporidian parasite within the sarcoplasm of muscle fibres. Molecular analysis of partial small subunit rRNA sequence data from the new species revealed an affinity to Ameson, a genus of Microsporidia infecting marine crustaceans. Based on morphological and molecular data, the new species is distinct from Nadelspora canceri, a related microsporidian that also infects the muscles of this host.

88,Andreanna caspii,1,"Molecular and ultrastructural characterization of Andreanna caspii n. gen., n. sp. (Microsporida: Amblyosporidae), a parasite of Ochlerotatus caspius (Diptera: Culicidae) ::: Abstract A new genus and species of microsporidia, Andreanna caspii n. gen., n. sp. is described from the mosquito, Ochlerotatus caspius (Pallas) based on ultrastructural morphology, developmental characteristics, and comparative sequence analyses of the small subunit (SSU) ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Parasite development is confined to fat body tissue and infected larvae appear swollen with dull white masses within the thorax and abdomen. Meronts have diplokaryotic nuclei and are delineated by a simple plasmalemma contiguous with the host cell cytoplasm. Merogony occurs by synchronous binary division followed by cytokinesis. Diplokaryotic sporonts undergo meiosis and synchronous nuclear division forming sporogonial plasmodia with two, four and eight nuclei enclosed within a persistent sporophorous vesicle. Cytokinesis of sporogonial plasmodia results in the formation of eight uninucleate spores. The episporontal space of early sporonts is filled with a homogeneous accumulation of electron dense granular inclusions and ovoid vesicles of various dimensions, transforming into an interwoven matrix during the initial phase of sporogenesis. Spores are oval, uninucleate and measure 4.8±0.3×3.1±0.4μm (fixed). The spore wall is 260μm thick with an irregular exospore consisting of two layers (150–170μm) and a thinner endospore (90–100μm). The anchoring disk is well developed and is contiguous with a lamellar polaroplast that occupies the anterior third of the spore and possess more narrow lamellae on the posterior end. The polar filament is gradually tapered and arranged in a single row consisting of six coils ranging from 180 to 150μm in diameter. The posterior vacuole (posterosome) is moderately sized and filled with a matrix of moderate electron density. Phylogenetic analysis of SSU rDNA from A. caspii and 30 other species of microsporidia including 11 genera parasitic in mosquitoes using maximum parsimony, neighbor joining and maximum likelihood methods showed A. caspii to be a sister group to the clade containing all of the Amblyospora species, including Culicospora, Edhazardia and Intrapredatorus, as well as Culicosporella and Hyalinocysta thus providing strong support for establishment of Andreanna as a separate genus.",adipose,adipose,Adipose tissue,thorax; Adipose tissue; caspii n.; DNA; abdomen; rDNA,1,5,0

(Diptera: Chironomidae) ::: Larvae of Chironomus plumosus, collected in North-Western Russia in September 2008, were infected with a microsporidium possessing broadly oval uninucleate spores in sporophorous vesicles. Sporogony and spore ultrastructure of this microsporidium differed from that of known microsporidian species, suggesting establishment of a new species, Anisofilariata chironomi, being a type species of a new genus. Sporogony di-, tetra-, octo-, and 16-sporoblastic. Fixed and stained spores are 4.7-6.8 x 3.4-5.4 microm in size, the spore measurements varying depending upon the number of spores in the sporophorous vesicle. The polaroplast is bipartite, with anterior and posterior parts composed of very thin and thick lamellae, respectively, and occupies the major volume of the spore. The polar filament is anisofilar, with two broad proximal and 10-13 narrow distal coils arranged in 2-4 layers. The sporophorous vesicle is bounded by a thin membrane and contains multiple tubular structures. Small subunit ribosomal DNA phylogeny showed basal position of the new microsporidium to a cluster uniting microsporidia infecting ciliates (Euplotespora binucleata), microcrustaceans (Glugoides intestinalis, Mrazekia macrocyclopis), lepidopteran insects (Cystosporogenes spp., Endoreticulatus spp.) and human (Vittaforma corneae), nested within Clade IV sensu Vossbrinck and Debrunner-Vossbrinck (2005 Folia Parasitol 52:131-142).

Molecular analyses revealed the two species belong to a clade of microsporidian parasites that preferentially infect the intestinal epithelium of insect and crustacean hosts. These parasites are morphologically distinguishable from other gut microsporidia infecting Artemia. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. Fixed spores measure 1·3×0·7 μm with 5–6 polar tube coils for A. rigaudi and 1·2×0·9 μm with 4 polar tube coils for E. artemiae. Transmission of both species is horizontal, most likely through the ingestion of spores released with the faeces of infected hosts. The minute size of these species, together with their intestinal localization, makes their detection and identification difficult. We developed two species-specific molecular markers allowing each type of infection to be detected within 3–6 days post-inoculation. Using these markers, we show that the prevalence of these microsporidia ranges from 20% to 75% in natural populations. Hence, this study illustrates the usefulness of molecular approaches to study prevalent, but cryptic, infections involving microsporidian parasites of gut tissues.",Intestinal epithelium,Intestinal epithelium,Intestinal epithelium,Intestinal epithelium; gut; gut tissues,1,2,0
94,Antonospora psocopterae,1,"New microsporidia parasitizing bark lice (Insecta: Psocoptera) ::: Abstract Two species of bark lice, Xanthocaecilius sommermanae Mockford and Polypsocus corruptus Hagen, collected in a canopy Malaise trap placed in Great Smoky Mountains National Park as part of a survey of the park’s fauna, were found to be infected with microsporidia. Diagnosis was originally based on light microscopy, and was confirmed by PCR amplification and electron microscopy. This is the first record of microsporidia infection in the insect order Psocoptera. Four morphological spore types corresponded to four original SSUrDNA sequences (Genbank accession no. FJ865221-24), suggesting infection with four microsporidia species. Two of those species were examined by electron microscopy. We describe here one new genus and two new species based on morphological and sequence data: Antonospora psocopterae sp. n. with elongated diplokaryotic spores, 4.4±0.05×1.9±0.03μm and Mockfordia xanthocaeciliae gen. n. sp. n. with ovocylindrical monokaryotic spores, 2.5±0.10×1.4±0.02μm. A. psocopterae displayed high sequence (95%) and structural similarity with Antonospora scoticae, fell within a well supported dichotomy with A. scoticae inside the Antonospora–Paranosema clade in phylogenetic analyses by NJ, PS and ML. M. xanthocaeciliae did not exhibit much sequence or structural similarity with any of known microsporidia species, except Encephalitozoon spp. M. xanthocaeciliae fell within one clade with Encephalitozoon spp. in phylogenies and shared with encephalitozoons structural resemblance and about 80% of SSUrDNA sequence identity. The other two species were not described and provisionally were placed to the collective genus Microsporidium as Microsporidium sp. 1 and Microsporidium sp. 4 from bark lice because of insufficient morphological data. The finding that samples fixed and stored for months in propylene glycol (“antifreeze”) are good enough for DNA sequence analysis and can be used for morphological analyses (if no better fixation alternatives are available), is promising for future surveys for microsporidia.",Adipose,Adipose,Adipose,Microsporidium sp. 4; Xanthocaecilius; bark; Microsporidium sp. 1,0,4,1

(Protozoa, microsporidia) a parasite of the communal bee, Andrena scotica Perkins, 1916 (Hymenoptera, andrenidae) ::: The new microsporidium Antonospora scoticae n. gen., n. sp., a parasite of the communal bee Andrena scotica, is described based on light microscopy, ultrastructural characteristics and the nucleotide sequence of the small subunit ribosomal RNA coding region. The parasite is apansporoblastic and develops in close contact with the host cytoplasm. All developmental stages are diplokaryotic. Cytoplasmic fission was not observed, but the sporogony is believed to be disporoblastic. Live spores are ovocylindrical, straight to slightly curved, and measure 6.8 x 2.7 μm whereas spores fixed and stained for TEM measure 5.0 x 1.8 υm. The exospore is four-layered, with an internal single layer followed by a thicker, more electron dense layer, then another single layer followed by a thin external double layer. The polar filament is isofilar and arranged in 15-22 coils in the posterior and mid-part of the spore. The polaroplast has tightly packed lamellae that become less densely packed in the posterior region. The coding region of the small subunit ribosomal RNA is 1371 base pairs long. Its GC content (62%) is significantly higher than previously reported for this group of organisms. The systematic position of the described microsporidium was found to be ambiguous and is discussed in the context of inconsistencies between the molecular and morphological taxonomy of microsporidia. A new genus is proposed for A. scoticae without defining superior taxa because the current developmental and morphological evidence is limited and partly contradictory to the molecular data. Current taxonomies of microsporidia are based on characters that are most likely polyphyletic in nature. Traditional systems of microsporidian taxonomy may need to be extensively revised, as molecular data become available.",adipose tissue (in gaster); haemolymph; haemocoel,adipose tissue; haemolymph; haemocoel,haemocoel; adipose tissue; haemolymph,ribosomal,0,1,3

(Fungi: Microsporidia), a Parasite of Daphnia magna Straus, 1820 (Crustacea: Branchiopoda) ::: ABSTRACT . We describe a new microsporidian species Binucleata daphniae, n. g., n. sp., that infects the integument cells lining the hemocoele cavity of the carapace and the postabdomen of the cladoceran Daphnia magna Straus. Infected cells filled with spores accumulate as large clusters in the carapace cavity and heavily infected hosts are detected by their opaque appearance. Despite the parasite's presence, infected Daphnia grow and molt, but have a reduced fecundity. During the parasite's life cycle, chain-like meronts with isolated nuclei are formed, giving rise to binucleate presporonts, the most frequently observed, characteristic developmental stage. In sporogony, the nuclei of the presporont separate, divide, and eight spores enclosed in a thin-walled sporophorous vesicle are formed. Spores are 4.9 × 2.5 μm in size (fresh) and have an anisofilar polar filament with eight coils. DNA sequence analysis places B. daphniae in a clade of microsporidians that parasitize crustaceans and mosquitoes and have assumed complex life cycles. Binucleata daphniae, however, has a simple and direct life cycle and can be transferred to naïve hosts and maintained as persistent infections in populations of its host D. magna. We propose that B. daphniae has simplified its life cycle by losing its secondary host, rendering it unique in this clade.",integumentary,integumentary,integumentary,carapace; cladoceran Daphnia; integument cells; DNA,0,4,1

It infects most tissues of adult male and female mosquitoes, destroying the midgut, Malpighian tubules, the fat body, muscles, hypoderm and connective tissues. It is usually transmitted with feces released by mosquitoes during feeding on cotton swabs with honey water. In sporogony the oval binucleate spores, 2.5-3 x 1.5-2 μm, have an anisofilar polar filament coiled in 9 coils in one row. Five anterior coils are of larger diameter than the posterior three to four.

Biopsied muscle tissue, examined by light and electron microscopy, revealed the presence of organisms developing in direct contact with muscle cell cytoplasm and fibers. No other tissue types were infected. All parasite stages contain diplokaryotic nuclei and all cell division is by binary fission. Sporogony is disporoblastic, producing 2.9 x 2 microns diplokaryotic spores containing 8-10 coils of the polar filament arranged in one to three rows, usually two. Additionally, this microsporidium produces electron-dense extracellular secretions and vesiculotubular appendages similar to Nosema algerae. However, the production of protoplasmic extensions which may branch and terminate in extensive vesiculotubular structures is unique to this parasite. Additionally, unlike Nosema algerae, its development occurred at warm blooded host temperature (37-38 degrees C) and unlike Nosema connori, which disseminates to all tissue types, B. vesicularum infected only muscle cells. Thus, a new genus and species is proposed. Because of the similarities with the genus Nosema, this new genus is placed in the family Nosematidae. Successful clearing of this infection (both clinically and histologically) resulted from treatment with albendazole and itraconozole.",striated muscles,striated muscles,striated muscles,tissue; muscle cells,0,2,1

Knowledge of their diseases, including high levels of research on Aphanomyces astaci (crayfish plague), show that disease plays a vital role during crayfish invasions. Microsporidian diseases in crayfish are less studied but are thought to have important links to crayfish health and invasion dynamics. In this study we provide a systematic description of a novel microsporidian parasite from the Floridian crayfish, Procambarus paeninsulanus, with additional genetic identification from related Microsporidia from Procambarus fallax, Cambarellus shufeldtii and Cambarellus blacki. This novel microsporidium from P. paeninsulanus is described in a new genus, Cambaraspora, and species, Cambaraspora floridanus, and represents a novel member of the Clade V Microsporidia within the Glugeidae. The parasite develops in the muscle tissue of P. paeninsulanus, within a sporophorous vesicle, and produces a spore with 19-21 turns of the polar filament measuring 6.136 ± 0.84 µm in length and 2.12 ± 0.23 µm in width. The muscle-infecting nature of the parasite suggests that it is horizontally transmitted. Genetic data for the 18S of the parasite from all hosts confirms its assignment to Clade V and reveal it to be a relative of multiple fish-infecting parasites. It shows closest genetic relationship to Glugea plecoglossi, but branches alongside multiple microsporidia from fish, crustaceans and eDNA isolates. The information presented here suggests that this novel parasite may have the potential to infect piscine hosts and is a likely mortality driver in the P. paeninsulanus population. Its potential as a control agent or wildlife disease invasion threat is explored, as well as the placement of this novel microsporidium within the Glugeidae.",muscle,muscle,muscle,paeninsulanus,0,1,1

All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. Merogonial reproduction was not observed. the sporogony comprises two sequences: one with free spores in parasitophorous vacuoles, the other in spherical, 5.6‐6.8 μm wide, sporophorous vesicles which lie in the cytoplasm. the free sporogony yields more than 20 spores per sporont. the vesicle‐bound sporogony produces 8, 12 or 16 spores. the envelope of the sporophorous vesicle is about 82 nm thick and layered. the internal layer is the plasma membrane of the sporont; the surface layer is electron dense with regularly arranged translucent components. Both spore types are spherical. They have an ∼ 35‐nm thick spore wall, with a plasma membrane, an electron‐lucent endospore, and an ∼ 14‐nm thick electron‐dense exospore. the polar sac is cup‐like and lacks a layered anchoring disc. the polar filament is arranged in two to three isofilar coils in the half of the spore opposite the nucleus. the coupling between the polar sac and the polar filament is characteristic. the surface of the polar filament is covered with regularly arranged membraneous chambers resembling a honeycomb. There is no polaroplast of traditional type. the cytoplasm lacks polyribosomes. the nucleus has a prominent, wide nucleolus. the two spore types have identical construction, but differ in dimensions and electron density. Free living spores are about 3.2 μm wide, the diameter of the polar filament proper is 102‐187 nm, the chambers of the honeycomb are 70‐85 nm high, and the polar sac is up to 425 nm wide. Living spores in the vesicle‐bound sporogony are about 2.1 μm wide, the polar filament measures 69‐102 nm, the chambers of the honeycomb are about 45 nm high, and these spores are more electron dense.

We have analysed one of these subclades and we describe a new microsporidian genus and species combination, and assemble a large group of structurally indistinguishable microsporidian parasites that infect adipose cells of their hosts and form pyriform spores of a certain type (“obtuse spores”). Obtuse spores are non-infectious by feeding to their crustacean hosts and it is plausible that microsporidia forming them actually are parasites of insects with aquatic larval stages, with an obligate two-host life cycle, analogous to the Amblyospora life cycle involving copepods and mosquitoes.",adipose,adipose,adipose,ssu; ITS; adipose; daphnids,1,3,0

The parasite infects the gut epithelium of the host larvae and possesses sporogonies of two types, polysporoblastic and disporoblastic, respectively, proceeding within the same host cell. In the sporogonial sequence of the first type, dozens of spherical monokaryotic spores within a thick-walled capsule are formed. The spores are 1.5–2.0 μm in diameter; the exospore possesses two to three bundles of tubular protrusions. In the sporogonial sequence of the second type, diplokaryotic oval spores, 2.5 × 1.5 μm in size, are formed within a compartment, partially surrounded with multilayered membranes. Spores of both types are similar in respect to inner structure, possessing a well-developed extrusion apparatus with (a) the anterior vesicular part of the polaroplast covering the lamellar posterior one and (b) isofilar polar filament with several coils in one row.

131,Cucumispora roeselii,1,"Parasites, Pathogens and Commensals in the ‘Low-Impact’ Non-Native Amphipod Host Gammarus Roeselii ::: BACKGROUND: Whilst vastly understudied, pathogens of non-native species (NNS) are increasingly recognised as important threats to native wildlife. This study builds upon recent recommendations for improved screening for pathogens in NNS by focusing on populations of Gammarus roeselii in Chojna, north-western Poland. At this location, and in other parts of continental Europe, G. roeselii is considered a well-established and relatively 'low-impact' invader, with little understanding about its underlying pathogen profile and even less on potential spill-over of these pathogens to native species. RESULTS: Using a combination of histological, ultrastructural and phylogenetic approaches, we define a pathogen profile for non-native populations of G. roeselii in Poland. This profile comprised acanthocephalans (Polymorphus minutus Goese, 1782 and Pomphorhynchus sp.), digenean trematodes, commensal rotifers, commensal and parasitic ciliated protists, gregarines, microsporidia, a putative rickettsia-like organism, filamentous bacteria and two viral pathogens, the majority of which are previously unknown to science. To demonstrate potential for such pathogenic risks to be characterised from a taxonomic perspective, one of the pathogens, a novel microsporidian, is described based upon its pathology, developmental cycle and SSU rRNA gene phylogeny. The novel microsporidian Cucumispora roeselii n. sp. displayed closest morphological and phylogenetic similarity to two previously described taxa, Cucumispora dikerogammari (Ovcharenko & Kurandina, 1987), and Cucumispora ornata Bojko, Dunn, Stebbing, Ross, Kerr & Stentiford, 2015. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to our discovery extending the host range for the genus Cucumispora Ovcharenko, Bacela, Wilkinson, Ironside, Rigaud & Wattier, 2010 outside of the amphipod host genus Dikerogammarus Stebbing, we reveal significant potential for the co-transfer of (previously unknown) pathogens alongside this host when invading novel locations. This study highlights the importance of pre-invasion screening of low-impact NNS and, provides a means to document and potentially mitigate the additional risks posed by previously unknown pathogens.",muscle,muscle,muscle,SSU,0,1,1

(microspora, glugeidae), a microsporidian parasite of the cabbage root fly Delia radicum (Linnaeus, 1758) (diptera, anthomyidae) ::: The microsporidium Cystosporogenes deliaradicae sp. no v., a parasite of the adipose tissue of adult cabbage root flies, Delia radicum in Denmark, is described based on light microscopic and ultrastructural characteristics. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. The sporogony is polysporoblastic, yielding 4–16 (most commonly 6 or 8) ovocylindrical spores, measuring 1.2–1.5 × 4.6–5.5 μm when fixed and stained. The spore wall has an approximately 43 nm thick, layered exospore with a median layer resembling a double membrane. The polaroplast is uniformly lamellar. The isofilar, 114–123 nm thick, polar filament is arranged in 11–15 (most commonly 12–13) coils in a single layer close to the spore wall. The angle of tilt is approximately 35°. The last coil touches the posterior pole of the spore. A sporophorous vesicle is produced by the sporont. The envelope is generated as a duplication of the plasma membrane. Typically the vesicle primordia grow from one pole of the sporont to the other. The episporontal space initially has granular inclusions. Later septate, persistent tubules of exospore material appear. Simultaneously with the release of sporoblasts, wide tubulus-like, non-persistent structures are formed. They are covered by regularly spaced electron-dense material. Anomalous sporogony was frequently observed, probably caused by a simultaneous parasitism by the fungus Strongwellsea castrans. The systematic position of the microsporidium is discussed, including the reasons for incorporating the genus into the family Glugeidae","fat body (especially prominent in thorax, close to hypoderm)",fat body,Adipose tissue,tubules; cabbage root; Adipose tissue; exospore material,1,3,0

In hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections of infected amphipods, the microsporidian was observed to infect muscle tissue surrounding the ovaries. Melanized hemocytic encapsulations were often observed in or near masses of microsporidians. The microsporidians appeared as spores measuring 1.99 ± 0.09 μm long by 1.19 ± 0.05 μm wide. Each spore contained eight coils of isofilar polar filaments that were arranged in single ranks. Polar filaments measured 71 ± 3 nm in diameter. A prominent lamellar polaroplast composed of ordered concentric membranes was found at the apical end of the spore surrounding the polar filament. A distinct posterior vacuole was observed at the distal end of the spore. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16s RNA sequences showed that the microsporidian belongs to the genus Dictyocoela, and is most similar to D. berillonum, yet distinctly different. The species is new, based on its morphology, genetic sequence, host, and location within the host.",Muscle surrounding ovaries,Muscle surrounding ovaries,Muscle,spore; concentric membranes; Muscle; ovaries,1,3,0

Establishing the new species was based on sequencing the ITS‐SSUrDNA region of the ribosomal gene and consequent SSUrDNA‐inferred phylogenetic analyses, as well as on comparison of pathogenesis, host specificity, and ultrastructure among Encephalitozoon species and isolates. The new species is closely related to E. lacertae and E. cuniculi. Analysis of the literature suggests that this microsporidium has been reported previously as an unidentified microsporidian species or isolate of E. cuniculi and may represent a common infection in bearded dragons. All stages of E. pogonae develop in parasitophorous vacuoles. Uninucleate spores on methanol‐fixed smears measured 2.1 × 1.1 μm, range 1.7–2.6 × 0.9–1.7 μm; on ultrathin sections spores measured 0.8–1.1 × 1.8–2.2 μm. Ultrastructural study revealed 3–6 polar filament coils, a mushroom‐shaped polar disk, and a polar sac embracing half of the volume occupied by the lamellar polaroplast. In activated spores, polar filament everted eccentrically.

Meronts underwent binary fission and the daughter cells transformed into clongate, chain-like sporonts that eventually separated into sporoblasts. The formation of components of the mature spores is described. The parasite, a species of Encephalitozoon, underwent development both in the cytoplasm and within a parasitophorous vacuole, distinguishing it from the morphologically similar species E. cuniculi and E. hellem, both of which have been described from lesions in the human eye and have been reported to develop exclusively within a parasitophorous vacuole.",eye cornea,eye cornea,eye cornea,parasitophorous,0,1,1

All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. The merogonial reproduction was revealed by small groups of merozoites. The dominant sporogony yields four sporoblasts by rosette-like budding, enclosed in a sporophorous vesicle produced by the sporont. Together with the tetrasporous sporogony production of macrospores in 3-, 2- or 1-sporous vesicles occurs. Spores are pyriform, with pointed anterior pole. Fixed tetraspores from A. nervosa measure 3.0-3.5 x 4.6-5.2 mu m. The greatest fixed macrospores observed were 10.4 mu m long. The spore wall has the normal three subdivisions, including a layered, ca 43 nm wide exospore, where the intermediate layer is a double-layer The polaroplast has two lamellar parts, with the anterior lamellae more closely packed. The polar filament is isofilar, with 20-25 coils in tetraspores, up to 34 coils in macrospores. The coils have approximately identical diameter in tetraspores and macrospores. Granular and tubular inclusions of two kinds appear in the episporontal space. Wide, septate tubules of exospore nature disappear when the spores mature. Narrow, thin-walled tubules persist. Macrospores often exhibit aberrant cytology. In A. nervosa the adipose tissue is more or less completely invaded by the parasite. The fat body lobes are not transformed into syncytia. Defense reactions were not observed in this host. Infection in M. lateralis was visible as local herds, and nodule formation with incorporation of dark pigment was observed. The species is compared to previously described microsporidia of caddis flies and the generic position is discussed.

A second species is now described that was associated with intestinal symptoms in a 32-year-old, human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive, Native American male homosexual. Stool studies and routine light microscopy of multiple small intestinal biopsies that showed atrophy with acute and chronic inilammation were without apparent patho- gens. Light microscopy of semi-thin plastic sections, cytochemical stains of paraffin sections, and ultrastructural studies revealed extensive microsporidial infection of enterocytes and submucosal macrophages. No other pathogens were identified. Unlike E bieneuri, this microsporidian appeared to develop within septated parasitophorous vacuoles, and lacked polar disks and clear clefts. It most closely resembled, but was distinguishable from, members of the genus Encephalitozoon.

The detailed ultrastructure of life cycle of the pathogen including proliferative and sporogonic developmental stages are provided. All stages of the parasite are haplokaryotic and develop in a vacuole bounded by a single membrane in contact with host cell cytoplasm. Sporogenesis is synchronous with the same developmental stage in one vacuole. Sporogony shows a characteristic of multinucleate sporogonial plasmodia divided by rosette-like division, producing 4 or 8 sporoblasts. The mature spore is ellipsoidal, length (mean) 1.7μm, width 1.0μm, with a uninucleate in the center of the sporoplasm, 7 turns of the polar filament, a bell-like polaroplast of compact membranes and obliquely positioned posterior vacuole.

Two genera, Endoreticulatus and Cystosporogenes, clearly separate into distinct but closely related clades based on small subunit ribosomal RNA analysis but are included in different families that are each polyphyletic. A microsporidium with morphology resembling the Endoreticulatus/Cystosporogenes clade was isolated from the grasshopper Poecilimon thoracicus from a site in Northwest Bulgaria. It produced intense infections in the digestive tract of the host but no behavioral changes were noted in infected individuals. Prevalence of the microsporidium increased over the active feeding season yearly. Mature spores were oval and measured 2.58±0.21μm×1.34±0.24μm, with 16 to approximately 32 spores in a parasitophorous vacuole. The spores were uninucleate and polar filament coils numbered 8–9 situated in a single row. The spore polaroplast consisted of an anterior lamellar section and a posterior vesicular section, and the posterior vacuole was reduced. Analyses of a 1221bp partial SSU-rRNA sequence indicated that the isolate is more closely related to the Endoreticulatus clade than to Cystosporogenes, but shows earlier phylogenetic separation from species infecting Lepidoptera and represents a new species, Endoreticulatus poecilimonae. To compare sequences of Endoreticulatus spp. from Lepidoptera to those infecting other insect orders, an isolate, Microsporidium itiiti Malone (1985), described from the Argentine stem weevil, Listronotus bonariensis, was sequenced. Like the grasshopper isolate, the weevil isolate is closely related but basal to the lepidopteran Endoreticulatus clade.

Molecular analyses revealed the two species belong to a clade of microsporidian parasites that preferentially infect the intestinal epithelium of insect and crustacean hosts. These parasites are morphologically distinguishable from other gut microsporidia infecting Artemia. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. Fixed spores measure 1·3×0·7 μm with 5–6 polar tube coils for A. rigaudi and 1·2×0·9 μm with 4 polar tube coils for E. artemiae. Transmission of both species is horizontal, most likely through the ingestion of spores released with the faeces of infected hosts. The minute size of these species, together with their intestinal localization, makes their detection and identification difficult. We developed two species-specific molecular markers allowing each type of infection to be detected within 3–6 days post-inoculation. Using these markers, we show that the prevalence of these microsporidia ranges from 20% to 75% in natural populations.

(Microsporida: Enterocytozoonidae), a parasite of the black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon (Decapoda: Penaeidae): Fine structure and phylogenetic relationships ::: Abstract A new microsporidian species, Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei sp. nov., is described from the hepatopancreas of the black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon (Crustacea: Decapoda). Different stages of the parasite are described, from early sporogonal plasmodia to mature spores in the cytoplasm of host-cells. The multinucleate sporogonal plasmodia existed in direct contact with the host-cell cytoplasm and contained numerous small blebs at the surface. Binary fission of the plasmodial nuclei occurred during early plasmodial development and numerous pre-sporoblasts were formed within the plasmodium. Electron-dense disks and precursors of the polar tubule developed in the cytoplasm of the plasmodium prior to budding of early sporoblasts from the plasmodial surface. Mature spores were oval, measuring 0.7×1.1μm and contained a single nucleus, 5–6 coils of the polar filament, a posterior vacuole, an anchoring disk attached to the polar filament, and a thick electron-dense wall. The wall was composed of a plasmalemma, an electron-lucent endospore (10nm) and an electron-dense exospore (2nm). DNA primers designed from microsporidian SSU rRNA were used to amplify an 848bp product from the parasite genome (GenBank Download FJ496356). The sequenced product had 84% identity to the matching region of SSU rRNA from Enterocytozoon bieneusi. Based upon ultrastructural features unique to the family Enterocytozoonidae, cytoplasmic location of the plasmodia and SSU rRNA sequence identity 16% different from E. bieneusi, the parasite was considered to be a new species, E. hepatopenaei, within the genus Enterocytozoon.",epithelium; hepatopancreas,epithelium; hepatopancreas,hepatopancreas; epithelium,hepatopancreas; Fine; plasmodia,1,2,1

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has recently become a model host for studying microsporidia through the identification of its natural microsporidian pathogen Nematocida parisii. However, it was unclear how widespread and diverse microsporidia infections are in C. elegans or other related nematodes in the wild. Here we describe the isolation and culture of 47 nematodes with microsporidian infections. N. parisii is found to be the most common microsporidia infecting C. elegans in the wild. In addition, we further describe and name six new species in the Nematocida genus. Our sampling and phylogenetic analysis further identify two subclades that are genetically distinct from Nematocida, and we name them Enteropsectra and Pancytospora. Interestingly, unlike Nematocida, these two genera belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens. All of these microsporidia are horizontally transmitted and most specifically infect intestinal cells, except Pancytospora epiphaga that replicates mostly in the epidermis of its Caenorhabditis host. At the subcellular level in the infected host cell, spores of the novel genus Enteropsectra show a characteristic apical distribution and exit via budding off of the plasma membrane, instead of exiting via exocytosis as spores of Nematocida. Host specificity is broad for some microsporidia, narrow for others: indeed, some microsporidia can infect Oscheius tipulae but not its sister species Oscheius sp. 3, and conversely some microsporidia found infecting Oscheius sp. 3 do not infect O. tipulae. We also show that N. ausubeli fails to strongly induce in C. elegans the transcription of genes that are induced by other Nematocida species, suggesting it has evolved mechanisms to prevent induction of this host response. Altogether, these newly isolated species illustrate the diversity and ubiquity of microsporidian infections in nematodes, and provide a rich resource to investigate host-parasite coevolution in tractable nematode hosts.",intestine (does not affect intestinal cells),intestine,Intestines,Intestines; epidermis,1,1,0

This study describes the first intranuclear microsporidian parasite of an invertebrate, the European edible crab Cancer pagurus L. (Decapoda: Cancridae). Infected crabs displayed no obvious external signs, and maximum apparent prevalence of infection within a monthly sample was 3.45 %. Infected hepatopancreatic tubules were characterised by varying numbers of hypertrophic and eosinophilic nuclei within epithelial cells. Parasite stages appeared as eosinophilic granular accumulations causing margination of host chromatin. In advanced cases, the tubule epithelia degenerated, with parasites and sloughed epithelial cells appearing in tubule lumens. All life stages of the parasite were observed within host nuclei. Uninucleate meronts were not detected, although binucleate stages were observed. Multinucleate Plasmodia (sporogonal Plasmodia) contained up to 22 nuclei in section, and late-stage Plasmodia contained multiple copies of apparatus resembling the polar filament and anchoring disk, apparently associated with individual plasmodial nuclei. As such, aggregation and early assembly of sporoblast components took place within the intact sporogonial Plasmodium, a feature unique to the Enterocytozoonidae. Liberation of sporoblasts from Plasmodia or the presence of liberated sporoblasts was not observed in this study. However, large numbers of maturing and mature spores (measuring 1.3 ± 0.02 x 0.7 ± 0.01 μm) were frequently observed in direct contact with the host nucleoplasm. Considering the shared features of this parasite with microsporidians of the family Enterocytozoonidae, and the unique presence of this parasite within the nucleoplasm of decapod crustacean hepatopancreatocytes, this parasite (Enterospora canceri) is proposed as the type species of a new genus (Enterospora) of microsporidian.

184,Enterospora nucleophila,1,"A new intranuclear microsporidium, Enterospora nucleophila n. sp., causing an emaciative syndrome in a piscine host (Sparus aurata), prompts the redescription of the family Enterocytozoonidae ::: Graphical abstract Highlights • A new species of microsporidium is described from the intestine of a marine teleost. • The ultrastructural and molecular analyses place it within the Enterocytozoonidae. • The Enterocytozoonidae family is amended. • Intranuclear stages are free in the nucleoplasm and those in the cytoplasm are in a parasitophorous vacuole. • This microsporidium is a potential threat for cultured fish as it drastically reduces growth. Abstract The presence of a new microsporidium is believed to be responsible for an emaciative syndrome observed in farmed gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) from different facilities along the Spanish coast. Infected fish were approximately half the average weight and significant mortality was attributed to the condition in some facilities. Clinical signs included anorexia, cachexia and pale internal organs. The microsporidium was found mainly in the intestinal mucosa and occasionally in the submucosa. Morphological, histopathological, ultrastructural and molecular phylogenetic studies were conducted to characterise this organism. This microsporidium undergoes intranuclear development in rodlet cells and enterocytes, and cytoplasmic development mainly in enterocytes and macrophages. The nucleus-infecting plasmodium contains several diplokarya and displays polysporous development which occurs without an interfacial envelope. In the host cell cytoplasm, the parasite develops within a membrane-bound matrix. In both infection locations, the polar tube precursors appear as disks, first with lucent centres, then as fully dense disks as they fuse to form the polar filament, all before division of the plasmodium into sporoblasts. Up to 16 intranuclear spores result from the sporogonic development of a single plasmodium, whereas more than 40 spores result from several asynchronous reproductive cycles in the cytoplasmic infection. Fixed spores are ellipsoidal and diplokaryotic, with five to six coils of an isofilar polar filament in a single row. ssrDNA-based molecular phylogenetic inference places this parasite as a sister clade to crustacean-infecting species of the Enterocytozoonidae and closer to Enterocytozoon bieneusi than to other fish-infecting microsporidians presenting intranuclear development, i.e. Nucleospora, Paranucleospora and Desmozoon. Our studies result in the erection of a new species, Enterospora nucleophila, within the family Enterocytozoonidae, and the description of this family is amended accordingly to accommodate the features of known species assigned to it. Severe histopathological damage occurs in intense infections and this microsporidian is considered a serious emerging threat in sea bream production.",primarily intestine; rarely in the stomach,primarily intestine; rarely in the stomach,stomach; intestine,intestinal mucosa; intestine; intranuclear; submucosa,1,3,1

The sporogony yields four sporoblasts by rosette-like budding, enclosed in a sporophorous vesicle produced by the sporont. Spores are pyriform with pointed anterior pole. The exospore is plurilayered and the polar filament is lightly anisofilar. Unfixed spores of E. invadens measure 2.2–2.5×3.2–3.6 µm. The polar filament makes 5–7 coils, the 2–3 anterior coils are the widest (100–126 nm). The anterior polaroplast has wide lamellae, the posterior closely packed lamellae. The host is Limnephilus fuscicornis (fam. Limnephilidae). The fat body lobes are completely invaded by the parasite and there is a prominent lysis of the host cells. Unfixed spores of E. circumscriptum measure about 2.1×2.5–3.7 µm. The polar filament makes 4–5 coils, the 1–2 anterior are the widest (94–102 nm). The anterior region of the polaroplast has wide chambers, the posterior closely packed lamellae. The host is Hydropsyche siltalai (fam. Hydropsychidae). Infection is mostly restricted to the superficial layers of cells in the fat body lobes, and there is only slight lysis of infected cells. The taxonomic problems with the tetrasporoblastic microsporidia and the assignment to genus are briefly discussed.",fat body,fat body,fat body,fat body; host cells,1,1,0
198,Flabelliforma montana,1,"A new microsporidian parasite, Flabelliforma montana n.g., n.sp., infecting Phlebotomus ariasi (Diptera, Psychodidae) in France ::: Flabelliforma montana, a new microsporidian genus and species, is described from the sandfly Phlebotomus ariasi. The parasite was found in sandflies collected in the commune of Roquedur, Gard, France, and represents the first microsporidium recorded from Old World sandflies. Meronts lie in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm and divide by binary fission or plasmotomy. Sporogonial plasmodia divide by multiple fission within a sporophorous vesicle, passing through a lobed fan-like stage before division into uninucleate sporoblasts. All stages have unpaired nuclei. Transmission is direct. Flabelliforma is one of nine genera of microsporidia with multisporous sporogony, all but one of which are currently considered to belong to one family, Pleistophoridae, but in reality are not closely related. The characters which differentiate Flabelliforma from the other multisporous genera are discussed and a key is provided for identification of the genera.",midgut (primary infection site); fat body,midgut; fat body,fat body; midgut,Flabelliforma montana n.g,0,1,2

Numerous blackish xenomas, ranged from 3 to 5 mm, were found in the body cavity associated with the mesenteries. Mature spores are monomorphic, ellipsoidal with an average size of 5(4–6) μm in length and 2.2 (2–3) μm in width. Observations of the ultrastructure revealed that the development was asynchronous and that the nuclei were isolated throughout the life cycle with uninucleate meronts. Sporoblasts were uninucleated and existed together with sporonts in a fully formed parasitophorous vacuole. The polar filament of the mature spore was isofilar with 24–28 coils, arranged in three rows. Phylogenetic analysis placed the current microsporidia within the clade grouping Glugea species and close to the species described from the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf. The morphometric and molecular comparison with other members of the genus Glugea evidenced the taxonomic novelty of the present form, suggesting that it should be considered as a new species.

In a heavy infection of the parasite xenomas develop in large number in various organs, viz., peritoneum, visceral cavity, ovaries, testis, fat body, pyloric caeca, spleen, muscle, liver, heart, gills, iris, etc., and cause serious damage to fish. The xenomas are variable in size, being 0.5-3 mm, rarely as large as 5 mm. Fresh spores of the parasite are elongate or ellipsoidal and are 5.1-6.2 x 2.0-2.5µ, the average of 200 spores being 5.8 x 2.1 Spores fixed in Bouin's solution and stained with Heidenhein's iron hematoxylin are 3.S-4.8 x 1.5-2.0 µ the average of 50 spores being 4.0 X 1.8 µ. Everted filaments are 180 µ at maximum, being 100-150 µ in the majority. The processes of schizogony and sporogony of the parasite studied with artificially infected ayu are in substance the same as those reported by Weissenberg (1968) on Glugea anomala and by Sprague and Yernick (1968) on G. weissenbergu A very small xenoma of 4x8 µ with a single schizont and a single host cell nucleus was found in the lamina propria of the villi of the gut of an ayu killed 5 days after infection. Sporonts in smear preparations of parasite are 3 x 4 µ and each sporont produce two spores. Therefore the parasite is classified into the genus Glugea. Inoculation experiments have shown that Salmo gairdneri is susceptible to the parasite, but. Gasterosteus acelatus microcephalus is unsusceptible. Of about 15 species of Glugea in fish, G. hertwigi has spores similar in size to those of the present Glugea, But the former differs from the latter in the following points. The hosts of G. hertwigi are Osmerus mordax and O. eperlanus and it has been reported by Weissenberg (1968) that Gasterosteus aceleatus is susceptible to G. hertwigi, G. anomala and G. weissenhergi are distinguishable in having smaller spores, 3 x 1.5-2 µ, and larger spores, 6.0-7.0 X 2.5-3.6 µ, respectively, and in having different hosts, the sticklebacks.

The microsporidian formed large whitish xenomas adhering to the peritoneal visceral organs of the host. Each xenoma consisted of a single hypertrophic cell, in the cytoplasm of which mature spores proliferated within parasitophorous vacuoles surrounded by numerous collagen fibers. Mature spores were ellipsoidal and uninucleated, measuring an average of 6.5 ± 0.5 μm in length and 3.4 ± 0.6 μm in width. The anchoring disk of the polar filament was subterminal, laterally shifted from the anterior pole of the spore. The isofilar polar filament coiled in 18–19 turns, forming two rows that surrounded the posterior vacuole. The latter occupied about one third of the spore length. The polaroplast surrounding the apical and uncoiled portion of the polar filament displayed two distinct regions: a lamellar region and an electron-dense globule. Molecular analysis of the rRNA genes, including the internal transcribed spacer region, and phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and neighbor joining demonstrated that this microsporidian parasite clustered with some Glugea species. Based on the differences found both at the morphological and molecular levels, to other members of the genus Glugea, the microsporidian infecting the blacktail comber is considered a new species, thus named Glugea serranus n. sp.",connective tissue of the coelomic cavity,connective tissue of the coelomic cavity,connective tissue,coelomic cavity; connective tissue,1,1,0

All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. The merogonial reproduction was revealed by small groups of merozoites. The dominant sporogony yields four sporoblasts by rosette-like budding, enclosed in a sporophorous vesicle produced by the sporont. Together with the tetrasporous sporogony production of macrospores in 3-, 2- or 1-sporous vesicles occurs. Spores are pyriform, with pointed anterior pole. Fixed tetraspores from A. nervosa measure 3.0-3.5 x 4.6-5.2 mu m. The greatest fixed macrospores observed were 10.4 mu m long. The spore wall has the normal three subdivisions, including a layered, ca 43 nm wide exospore, where the intermediate layer is a double-layer The polaroplast has two lamellar parts, with the anterior lamellae more closely packed. The polar filament is isofilar, with 20-25 coils in tetraspores, up to 34 coils in macrospores. The coils have approximately identical diameter in tetraspores and macrospores. Granular and tubular inclusions of two kinds appear in the episporontal space. Wide, septate tubules of exospore nature disappear when the spores mature. Narrow, thin-walled tubules persist. Macrospores often exhibit aberrant cytology. In A. nervosa the adipose tissue is more or less completely invaded by the parasite. The fat body lobes are not transformed into syncytia. Defense reactions were not observed in this host. Infection in M. lateralis was visible as local herds, and nodule formation with incorporation of dark pigment was observed. The species is compared to previously described microsporidia of caddis flies and the generic position is discussed.

This parasite was previously identified as Octosporea bayeri Jírovec, 1936 and has become a model system to study the ecology, epidemiology, evolution and genomics of microsporidia - host interactions. Here, we present evidence that shows its differences from O. bayeri. Hamiltosporidium tvaerminnensis exclusively infects the adipose tissue, the ovaries and the hypodermis of Daphnia magna and is found only in host populations located in coastal rock pool populations in Finland and Sweden. Merogonial stages of H. tvaerminnensis have isolated nuclei; merozoites are formed by binary fission or by the cleaving of a plasmodium with a small number of nuclei. A sporogonial plasmodium with isolated nuclei yields 8 sporoblasts. Elongated spores are generated by the most finger-like plasmodia. The mature spores are polymorphic in shape and size. Most spores are pyriform (4·9–5·6×2·2–2·3 μm) and have their polar filament arranged in 12–13 coils. A second, elongated spore type (6·8–12·0×1·6–2·1 μm) is rod-shaped with blunt ends and measures 6·8–12·0×1·6–2·1 μm. The envelope of the sporophorous vesicle is thin and fragile, formed at the beginning of the sporogony. Cytological and molecular comparisons with Flabelliforma magnivora, a parasite infecting the same tissues in the same host species, reveal that these two species are very closely related, yet distinct. Moreover, both cytological and molecular data indicate that these species are quite distant from F. montana, the type species of the genus Flabelliforma. We therefore propose that F. magnivora also be placed in Hamiltosporidium gen.

(Microsporidia: Glugeidae) infecting the lizardfish Saurida lessepsianus (Pisces: Synodontidae) inhabiting the Red Sea ::: Heterosporosis is an increasingly important microsporidian disease distributed worldwide, impacting wild and farmed-raised fish in both fresh and marine water environments. Twenty three out of 130 (17.69%) of the lizardfish Saurida lessepsianus were found to be naturally infected with microsporidian parasites. The rate of parasitic infection was increased during winter reaching 29.23% (19/65) and fall to 6.15% (4/65) in summer. The infection was recorded as numerous macroscopic whitish cysts reached 3.8–6.5 mm in diameter embedded in the abdominal cavity, skeletal muscles and mesenteric tissues of the infected fish inducing an enormous hypertrophy of infected tissues. Light microscopic examination revealed that parasitic foci were encapsulated by a host–derived fibrous membrane containing different developmental stages of the parasite. Spores were oval to pyriform in shape. Transmission electron microscopic study showed the presence of smooth membranes of the sarcoplasmic reticulum forming a thick, amorphous coat surrounding the various developmental stages of the examined parasite (meronts, sporont, sporoblasts, and spores). Mature spores were electron dense and uninucleate. The anchoring disk was found in a central position at the anterior end of the spore and a large vacuole was located at the posterior end. There was a definite number (7–8) of the polar filament turns. Molecular analysis based on the 16 small subunit (SSU) rDNA gene was performed to determine the phylogenetic position of the present parasite species. A 615 bp region of the 16SSU rDNA gene of the studied parasite was sequenced and deposited in GenBank under the accession number MF769371. Multiple sequence alignment demonstrated a high degree of similarity (>82%) with other twenty microsporidian species isolated from different aquatic hosts. The most closely related sequence was provided by the GenBank entry JF745533 for Heterosporis saurida isolated from the marine fish Saurida undosquamis with the highest percentage of identity (98%) and lowest divergence value (0.9).

(Microsporidia), hyperparasitic in Marteilia cochillia (Paramyxida), is closely related to crustacean-infecting microspordian taxa ::: SUMMARY The Paramyxida, closely related to haplosporidians, paradinids, and mikrocytids, is an obscure order of parasitic protists within the class Ascetosporea. All characterized ascetosporeans are parasites of invertebrate hosts, including molluscs, crustaceans and polychaetes. Representatives of the genus Marteilia are the best studied paramyxids, largely due to their impact on cultured oyster stocks, and their listing in international legislative frameworks. Although several examples of microsporidian hyperparasitism of paramyxids have been reported, phylogenetic data for these taxa are lacking. Recently, a microsporidian parasite was described infecting the paramyxid Marteilia cochillia, a serious pathogen of European cockles. In the current study, we investigated the phylogeny of the microsporidian hyperparasite infecting M. cochillia in cockles and, a further hyperparasite, Unikaryon legeri infecting the digenean Meiogymnophallus minutus, also in cockles. We show that rather than representing basally branching taxa in the increasingly replete Cryptomycota/Rozellomycota outgroup (containing taxa such as Mitosporidium and Paramicrosoridium), these hyperparasites instead group with other known microsporidian parasites infecting aquatic crustaceans. In doing so, we erect a new genus and species (Hyperspora aquatica n. gn., n.sp.) to contain the hyperparasite of M. cochillia and clarify the phylogenetic position of U. legeri. We propose that in both cases, hyperparasitism may provide a strategy for the vectoring of microsporidians between hosts of different trophic status (e.g. molluscs to crustaceans) within aquatic systems. In particular, we propose that the paramyxid hyperparasite H. aquatica may eventually be detected as a parasite of marine crustaceans. The potential route of transmission of the microsporidian between the paramyxid (in its host cockle) to crustaceans, and, the ‘hitch-hiking’ strategy employed by H. aquatica is discussed.",Primary cells,Primary cells,Primary cells,cockles,0,1,1

(Microsporidia) Infecting the Arrow Goby ( Clevelandia ios) ::: Abstract Gonadal infections by a novel microsporidium were discovered in 34% (13/38) of arrow gobies, Clevelandia ios, sampled over a 3‐yr period from Morro Bay Marina in Morro Bay, California. Gonadal tumors had been reported in arrow gobies from this geographic area. The infected gonads, found primarily in females, typically appeared grossly as large, white‐gray firm and lobulated masses. Histological examination revealed large, multilobate xenomas within the ovaries and no evidence of neoplasia. Typical of the genus Ichthyosporidium, the large xenomas were filled with developmental stages and pleomorphic spores. Wet mount preparations showed two general spore types: microspores with mean length of 6.2 (7.0–4.9, SD = 0.6, N = 20) μm and mean width of 4.3 (5.3–2.9, SD = 0.8) μm; and less numerous macrospores with mean length of 8.5 (10.1–7.1, SD = 1.0, N = 10) μm and mean width of 5.5 (6.2–4.8, SD = 0.5) μm. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated stages consistent with the genus and 35–50 turns of the polar filament. Small subunit rDNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the parasite from arrow gobies was most closely related to, but distinct from Ichthyosporidium sp. based on sequences available in GenBank.

Reproduction is restricted to the production of sporoblasts. The sporont has isolated nuclei, and the external pan of the sporont (plasma membrane and peripheral zone of cytoplasm) remains as an envelope collecting the uninucleate sporoblasts. Sporogony is by vacuolation, and mature spores are spherical to slightly ovoid and lack a polaroplast.

(Microsporida: Amblyosporidae) from the predacious mosquito Culex fuscanus Wiedemann (Diptera: Culicidae) ::: A microsporidium infecting the predacious mosquito Culex fuscanus Wiedemann, collected from Liu-Chiu Islet of Taiwan, was shown to be heterosporous. Two different types of haploid spores, one oval and the other lanceolate, were concurrently produced in the infected larvae. Merogony preceding the sequence leading to oval meiospores ended with the formation of a binucleate sporont with similar ultrastructural features to meronts. Synaptonemal complexes, suggesting that meiosis was involved during this sporogony, appeared in both nuclei of the sporont. The polar filament in the mature meiospore was anisofilar. Nine coiled turns of the polar filament were shown turning about the posterior portion of the spore. The polaroplast was composed of an anterior lamellate part and a posterior vesicular part. The anchoring disc was at the top of the straight portion of the polar filament. The meront of the lanceolate spore cannot be confirmed in this study. Two uninucleate lanceolate spores were eventually formed via nuclear dissociation. The polaroplast of the lanceolate spore was divided into an anterior multi-chambered part and a posterior of reticulate part. The polar filament was of the isofilar type, consisting of at least 5-6 coils. This parasite was extremely similar to the species Amblyospora trinus; in spore shape and development; but different in spore size and their hosts. Although it was similar to species of Amblyospora in host/parasite relations, we would rather assign this parasite to a newly established genus, i.e. Intrapredatorus and the name Intrapredatorus barri n.g., n.sp. was given for this microsporidium. The characteristics of the new genus was discussed in this article. However, its transmission routes remained uncertain thus far.",fat body,fat body,fat body,Islet; nuclei; Synaptonemal,0,3,1

(Microspora, Tuzetiidae), a Microsporidian Parasite of Ptychoptera paludosa (Diptera, Ptychopteridae) ::: The microsporidium Janacekia adipophila n. sp., a parasite of Ptychoptera paludosa larvae in Sweden, is described based on light microscopic and ultrastructural characteristics. Merogonial stages and sporonts are diplokaryotic. Merozoites are formed by rosette‐like division. Sporonts develop into sporogonial plasmodia with isolated nuclei. These plasmodia give rise to 8–16 sporoblasts by rosette‐like budding. A sporophorous vesicle is initiated by the sporogonial plasmodium. Sporoblasts and spores are enclosed in individual sporophorous vesicles. Granular inclusions of the vesicles, visible using light microscopy, discriminate sporogonial stages from stages of the merogony. The monokaryotic, fresh spores are oval with blunt ends, measuring 4.2‐6.3 × 9.1‐11.2 μm. Macrospores are formed in small numbers. The spore wall has three subdivisions and the exospore is electron‐dense. The polaroplast has two parts: closely arranged lamellae anteriorly, wider sac‐like compartments posteriorly. The isofilar polar filament, 191–264 nm wide, has 12‐13 coils, which are arranged in one layer in the posterior half of the spore. The electron‐dense inclusions of the sporophorous vesicle are modified during sporogony, and vesicles with mature spores are traversed by 21–27 nm wide tubules, which connect the exospore with the envelope of the vesicle. The walls of the tubules, the envelope of the vesicles, and the surface layer of the exospore are all identical double‐layered structures. The microsporidium is compared to microsporidia of Ptychopteridae and Tipulidae and to related microsporidia of the family Tuzetiidae.",adipose tissue,adipose tissue,adipose tissue,paludosa larvae,0,1,1

Spores are ovoid, ranging in size from 2.8 ± 0.3 micrometers in total length and 1.9 ± 0.4 micrometers in width (measurements of 30 spores made by calculation from micrograph). The polar filament has 9-10 coils in 1-2 rows. Development occurs in direct contact with host muscle cell cytoplasm, without xenoma or sporophorous vesicle. Phylogenetic analysis of the new species and of 35 other microsporidians known to infect fish using 1,115 base pairs of aligned 1 6S rRNA gene indicate the new species is most closely related to Kabatana takedai. However, the new species differs by 11 % sequence divergence from K. takedai. Divergence in morphology and genetic data allow for diagnosis from all other fish-infecting microsporidia and supports recognition of a new species of microsporidian, Kabatana newberryi n. sp., presently known only from a suspected specific host, the endangered tidewater goby Eucyclogobius newberryi.",muscle,muscle,Set of muscles,Kabatana newberryi n.; Set of muscles,1,1,0

This parasite develops in the skeletal muscle of the abdominal cavity, forming whitish cyst-like structures containing numerous spores. Mature spores, lightly pyriform to ellipsoidal with rounded ends and measuring 4.25 ± 0.38 X 2.37 ± 0.42 μm (n = 30), were observed. The spore wall, which measured about 102 nm, was composed of 2 layers with approximately the same thickness. The isofilar polar filament was coiled, with 9-10 (rarely 8) turns. The posterior vacuole appeared as a pale area, occupying about 1/3 of the spore length, and contained a spherical posterosome composed of granular material that was denser at the periphery. The myofibrils located near the spores appeared to be in advanced degradation. Molecular analysis of the rRNA genes, including the ITS region, and phylogenetic analyses using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Baysesian inference were performed. The ultrastructural characteristics of the spores and the phylogenetic data strongly suggested that it is a new species related to Kabatana, Microgemma, Potaspora, Spraguea, and Tetramicra.

292,Merocinta davidii,1,"Ultrastructure and life cycle of Merocinta davidii gen et sp. nov, a dimorphic microsporidian parasite of Mansonia africana (Diptera: Culicidae) from Tanzania ::: Mansonia africana larvae were sampled at three sites in NE Tanzania, between June and September 1987. At each site between 2.5 and 5.7% were infected with a multisporous microsporidian parasite. The ovoid spores measured 2.5 × 1.5 •m. Meronts were diplokaryotic with electron-dense, thickened unit membranes. Repeated division of the diplokarya gave rise to multinucleate plasmodia, the plasma membrane of which was entirely surrounded by two other membranes interpreted as host endoplasmic reticulum. Both membranes were studded with ribosomes. Meronts became ribbon-like before division, the endoplasmic reticulum dividing with the parasite. At the onset of sporogony the two nuclei of the diplokaryon separated and the electron-dense coat was sloughed off. Nuclear division and cytoplasmic division gave rise to uninucleate sporoblasts and spores. Adult M. africana collected at one of the three sites were infected with two diplokaryotic microsporidia, designated Type A and Type B, which differed only in the size of the spores. Spores of Type A measured 3.4 ×1.8 •m and those of Type B measured 6.6 × 2.9 •m; both types were binucleate. Type A infected 10.8 and Type B 5.8% of the adults collected. Mixed infections were not observed. In transovarial transmission trials, larvae were not successfully reared from adults infected with Type B. However, 11.3% of progeny from females infected with Type A exhibited multisporous microsporidian infections indistinguishable from those found in larvae collected at that site, showing that the multisporous parasite in larvae and the Type A infection of adults represent different stages in the life cycle of a single species.

The cell parasite, the development of which is described here, infects mainly archaeocytes but also spongioblasts and amphidiskoblasts. Even a moderate infection results in significant malformation of the gemmule covering. In the thesocyte nucleus, the parasite can survive the resting phase of the gemmule. After the gemmule has hatched, the parasite, again in the virulent form, is present in the young, developing sponge. The parasite may be a microsporidian of the primitive type, close to the genus Metchnikovella, which typically occurs in gregarines.",archaeocytes; spongioblasts; amphidiskoblasts,archaeocytes; spongioblasts; amphidiskoblasts,archaeocytes; spongioblasts; amphidiskoblasts,archaeocytes; spongioblasts; cell,2,1,1
296,Microgemma carolinus,1,"Ultrastructural and molecular studies of Microgemma carolinus n. sp. (Microsporidia), a parasite of the fish Trachinotus carolinus (Carangidae) in Southern Brazil ::: SUMMARY A new species of Microsporidia Microgemma carolinus n. sp. found in the marine teleost Trachinotus carolinus collected in Florianópolis, Brazil was described based on light, ultrastructural and phylogenetic studies. This parasite developed in the liver forming whitish xenomas that contained different developmental stages with monokaryotic nuclei. The periphery of the xenoma presented some vacuolization and possessed several small projections in the membrane. The mature spores, measuring 3·8 ± 0·4 μm in length and 2·4 ± 0·4 μm in width, were slightly pyriform to ellipsoidal and had rounded ends. The polaroplast was bipartite and the isofilar polar filament was coiled with 8 – 9 turns in a single or double row at the posterior end of the spore. The nucleus was voluminous and in a central position, measuring ∼0·9 μm in diameter. A large posterior vacuole appeared as a pale area, occupying about a third of the spore length. The SSU rRNA gene was sequenced and analysed using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and neighbour-joining methods. This study allowed us to conclude that this was a new species of the genus Microgemma, being the first description of this genus from among South America fauna.",Liver,Liver,Liver,spore; pale,0,2,1
298,Microgemma tilanpasiri,1,"Microsporidians infecting eel gobies (Gobiidae: Amblyopinae) from Malaysia, with a description of Microgemma tilanpasiri n. sp. from the burrowing goby Trypauchen vagina ::: A new species of microsporidia, Microgemma tilanpasiri n. sp., is described infecting the burrowing goby, Trypauchen vagina, from Malaysia. The microsporidian forms macroscopic xenomas in the host liver which are packed with mature spores. Mature spores are slightly pyriform to oval in shape measuring 3.92 ± 0.21 μm in length and 2.87 ±0.16 pm in width. No pre-spore stages were observed during electron microscopy studies and mature spores had a single nucleus and 12-13 turns of an isofilar polar filament, arranged in two rows. Sequencing of the ribosomal DNA indicated a strong phylogenetic relationship within the Tetramicridae and to other members of the genus Microgemma. The most similar species in terms of genetic distance is M. carolinus with a similarity of 99.23% over 1295 bases of the small subunit of ribosomal DNA. However, differences in the number of turns of the polar filament combined with host and geographical differences, support M. tilanpasiri as a novel microsporidian species. This represents the first description of Microgemma from the Western Pacific and the first from the Gobiidae family of fishes. Related blackfin eel gobies from the same sampling site were found to be uninfected with M. tilanpasiri; however one fish was infected with Glugea sp. in the visceral mesentery. We conclude that in spite of the low genetic distances observed in ribosomal DNA sequences between geographically distant xenoma-forming microsporidians from both Microgemma and Glugea, that they probably represent a number of different species of parasite that may actually be quite host specific.",liver,liver,liver,eel gobies; Trypauchen vagina; visceral mesentery,0,3,1

309,Microsporidium aurata,1,"Morphological and phylogenetic description of a new xenoma-inducing microsporidian, Microsporidium aurata nov. sp., parasite of the gilthead seabream Sparus aurata from the Red Sea ::: A new species of Microsporidia found in the marine teleost Sparus aurata collected from Hurghada coasts along the Red Sea, Egypt was described based on light and ultrastructural studies. Twenty three (30.6 %) out of 75 of the examined fish were parasitized with a microsporidian parasite. Numerous macroscopic whitish cysts embedded in the peritoneal cavity were observed to infect many organs of the body including muscles, connective tissues, and the intestinal epithelium. The infection was developed as tumor-like masses of often up to 5 mm in diameter inducing an enormous hypertrophy to the infected organs. Fresh spores appeared mostly ovoid to pyriform in shape reaching a size of 1.7 ± 0.5 (1.5–2.5) μm × 1.3 ± 0.4 (1–2) μm; they possessed a large vacuole at the posterior end. These spores were located within a sporophorous vesicle which was bound by a thick amorphous wall. The ultrastructural features support the placement of the present species within the genus Microsporidium. The developmental stages were enclosed within a xenoma structure that was bounded by a double-layered cyst wall. The life cycle of the microsporidian pathogen described herein included four stages: proliferation (merogony), sporogony, sporoblast, spores, and liberation. Mature spores appeared electron dense, uninucleate, and were ellipsoidal in shape. At the anterior end of the spore, the anchoring disk was found in a central position. There was a definite number (5–11) of turns of the polar tube. A 538-bp region of the SSU rDNA gene of the studied species was sequenced (GenBank accession number: KF0220444). Multiple sequence alignment calculated a high degree of similarity (>92 %) with six microsporidian species. The most closely related sequence was provided by the GenBank entry AF151529 for Microsporidium prosopium isolated from Hyperoplus lanceolatus differing in 67 nucleotide positions in its SSU rDNA with the highest percentage of identity (97.2 %) and the lowest divergence value (0.20). Variations in the morphology of the spores and developmental stages between the two species revealed that the two species are different. The site of infection in the host and description of the onset of parasite development are strong criteria for the placement of the microsporidian parasite of the fish S. aurata within the genus Microsporidium as a new species, and we propose to name it Microsporidium aurata nov. sp.",general infection (of organs); muscles; connective tissues; and the intestinal epithelium,general infection; muscles; connective tissues; and the intestinal epithelium,general infection; intestinal epithelium; connective tissues; muscles,intestinal epithelium; connective tissues; spore; Microsporidium aurata nov.; vacuole; gilthead seabream Sparus aurata; muscles; organs; peritoneal cavity,3,6,1

Diagnosis was originally based on light microscopy, and was confirmed by PCR amplification and electron microscopy. This is the first record of microsporidia infection in the insect order Psocoptera. Four morphological spore types corresponded to four original SSUrDNA sequences (Genbank accession no. FJ865221-24), suggesting infection with four microsporidia species. Two of those species were examined by electron microscopy. We describe here one new genus and two new species based on morphological and sequence data: Antonospora psocopterae sp. n. with elongated diplokaryotic spores, 4.4±0.05×1.9±0.03μm and Mockfordia xanthocaeciliae gen. n. sp. n. with ovocylindrical monokaryotic spores, 2.5±0.10×1.4±0.02μm. A. psocopterae displayed high sequence (95%) and structural similarity with Antonospora scoticae, fell within a well supported dichotomy with A. scoticae inside the Antonospora–Paranosema clade in phylogenetic analyses by NJ, PS and ML. M. xanthocaeciliae did not exhibit much sequence or structural similarity with any of known microsporidia species, except Encephalitozoon spp. M. xanthocaeciliae fell within one clade with Encephalitozoon spp. in phylogenies and shared with encephalitozoons structural resemblance and about 80% of SSUrDNA sequence identity. The other two species were not described and provisionally were placed to the collective genus Microsporidium as Microsporidium sp. 1 and Microsporidium sp. 4 from bark lice because of insufficient morphological data.

(Crustacea, Copepoda) ::: The ultrastructure and molecular phylogeny of a new microsporidium Mrazekia macrocyclopis sp.n., a parasite of the copepod Macrocyclops albidus (Jur.) in North-West of Russia are described. All stages of its life cycle are diplokaryotic. Fresh spores are rod-shaped and 7.3-10.5 × 1.6-2.3 μm in size. Spore ultrastructure is typical of Mrazekia. The polar tube consists of the anterior clavate manubrium followed by a thin filament arranged in 3.5-4.5 nearly vertical coils. Spores are enclosed in individual sporophorous vesicles. SSU rDNA sequence analysis showed attribution of the new species to a cluster of microsporidia infecting insects (Cystosporogenes, Endoreticulatus), microsrustaceans (Glugoides), vertebrates (Vittaforma) and ciliates (Euplotespora) nested within the clade IV sensu Vossbrinck, Debrunner-Vossbrinck (2005). Mrazekia macrocyclopis is not therefore closely related to Bacillidium vesiculoformis, another microsporidium with rod-shaped spores, and the polyphyletic nature of the family of Mrazekiidae is obvious.",Adipose,Adipose,Adipose,Macrocyclops albidus; rDNA,0,2,1

A new species of Microsporidia classified to a new genus was observed in the trunk muscle of commercial hake (Merluccius capensis/paradoxus complex) from Namibian fisheries. Macroscopic examination revealed thin and dark filaments inserted among muscle fibers. Inside the filaments were many sporophorous vesicles with about 30–50 spores per vesicle. The shape of the spore was pyriform and the extruded polar filament was of moderate length (up to 4.29 μm, n=12). This new species of Microsporidia is described using macrophotography, microphotography, staining, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as well as molecular methods. Its 16S rRNA was found to be similar to that of Microsporidium prosopium Kent et al., 1999, while both sequences were quite different from 16S rRNA sequences known for other Microsporidia. Nevertheless, this new species is separated morphologically from M. prosopium by the presence of 11–12 anisofilar coils and the formation of the xenoma at the site of infection.

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has recently become a model host for studying microsporidia through the identification of its natural microsporidian pathogen Nematocida parisii. However, it was unclear how widespread and diverse microsporidia infections are in C. elegans or other related nematodes in the wild. Here we describe the isolation and culture of 47 nematodes with microsporidian infections. N. parisii is found to be the most common microsporidia infecting C. elegans in the wild. In addition, we further describe and name six new species in the Nematocida genus. Our sampling and phylogenetic analysis further identify two subclades that are genetically distinct from Nematocida, and we name them Enteropsectra and Pancytospora. Interestingly, unlike Nematocida, these two genera belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens. All of these microsporidia are horizontally transmitted and most specifically infect intestinal cells, except Pancytospora epiphaga that replicates mostly in the epidermis of its Caenorhabditis host. At the subcellular level in the infected host cell, spores of the novel genus Enteropsectra show a characteristic apical distribution and exit via budding off of the plasma membrane, instead of exiting via exocytosis as spores of Nematocida. Host specificity is broad for some microsporidia, narrow for others: indeed, some microsporidia can infect Oscheius tipulae but not its sister species Oscheius sp. 3, and conversely some microsporidia found infecting Oscheius sp. 3 do not infect O. tipulae. We also show that N. ausubeli fails to strongly induce in C. elegans the transcription of genes that are induced by other Nematocida species, suggesting it has evolved mechanisms to prevent induction of this host response.

365,Nematocida displodere,1,"Discovery of a Natural Microsporidian Pathogen with a Broad Tissue Tropism in Caenorhabditis elegans ::: Microbial pathogens often establish infection within particular niches of their host for replication. Determining how infection occurs preferentially in specific host tissues is a key aspect of understanding host-microbe interactions. Here, we describe the discovery of a natural microsporidian parasite of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that displays a unique tissue tropism compared to previously described parasites of this host. We characterize the life cycle of this new species, Nematocida displodere, including pathogen entry, intracellular replication, and exit. N. displodere can invade multiple host tissues, including the epidermis, muscle, neurons, and intestine of C. elegans. Despite robust invasion of the intestine very little replication occurs there, with the majority of replication occurring in the muscle and epidermis. This feature distinguishes N. displodere from two closely related microsporidian pathogens, N. parisii and N. sp. 1, which exclusively invade and replicate in the intestine. Comparison of the N. displodere genome with N. parisii and N. sp. 1 reveals that N. displodere is the earliest diverging species of the Nematocida genus. Over 10% of the proteins encoded by the N. displodere genome belong to a single species-specific family of RING-domain containing proteins of unknown function that may be mediating interactions with the host.

(Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and its relationship to microsporidia that infect other coccinellids ::: Graphical abstract Highlights • This is the first formal description of a microsporidium from Adalia bipunctata. • Diplokaryotic spores (6.10×3.01μm) had isofilar polar filaments with 10–18 coils. • Flight muscles and fat body were the most heavily infected host tissues. • The genome sequence of the microsporidium was 97% similar to Nosema bombi. Abstract The two-spotted lady beetle, Adalia bipunctata L., is a tree-dwelling lady beetle endemic to parts of Europe, Central Asia and North America that is commercially available for aphid control in Europe and North America. Lady beetles host a wide variety of symbionts including parasitoids, viruses, eugregarines, fungi, bacteria, nematodes and microsporidia. Four species of microsporidia have been described from lady beetles, and an undescribed microsporidium was recently isolated from local populations of A. bipunctata in Nova Scotia, Canada. In a previous study, this pathogen prolonged the development of A. bipunctata larvae but had no effect on adult fecundity, longevity or sex ratios. The objective of this study was to formally describe the microsporidium by means of its ultrastructure, tissue pathology and molecular characterization. All stages of the microsporidium were diplokaryotic and developed in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm. Mature spores measured 4.25±0.09×1.82±0.03μm (SE, n=49, from micrographs) and fresh spores measured 6.10±0.06×3.01±0.05μm (±SE, n=60; range: 5.0–6.9×2.18–3.86μm). The polar filament was isofilar with 10–18 coils that were frequently arranged in a single row. The lamellar polaroplast was not typically visible and spores contained a relatively small posterior vacuole. Both the flight muscles and fat body were heavily infected and a large number of spores were observed within and between the cells of these tissues. The ovaries, developing oocytes, spermatocytes and accessory glands within the testes, midgut epithelium, Malpighian tubules, ileum, colon, and ventral nerve cord were also infected but not as heavily. Connective tissue near the cuticle and surrounding the trachea were lightly infected. The presence of spores in both the alimentary canal and ovaries (particularly within developing oocytes) suggests that the microsporidium can be transmitted per os (horizontally) and transovarially (vertically). Molecular analysis of the genome of the microsporidium described in this study was 97% similar to Nosema bombi and 96% similar to Nosema thomsoni, Nosema vespula and Nosema oulemae. Based on information gained during this study, we propose that the microsporidium in A. bipunctata be given the name Nosema adaliae sp.

Although lacewings are known for their symbiotic association with yeasts and bacteria, there are few reports of microsporidia in these natural enemies. An undescribed microsporidium was found in Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) during the routine examination of specimens that were obtained from a commercial insectary for biological pest control. The objective of this study was to describe the pathogen by means of ultrastructure, molecular characterization and tissue pathology. All stages of the microsporidium were diplokaryotic and developed in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm. Merogony and sporogony were not observed. Mature spores measured 3.49±0.10×1.52±0.05μm and had an isofilar polar filament with 8–10 coils that were frequently arranged in a single row, although double rows were also observed. Spores contained a lamellar polaroplast and a relatively small and inconspicuous polar vacuole was observed in the posterior region of about half of the spores that were examined. Tubular structures, similar in appearance to those in Nosema granulosis were observed in both sporonts and in spores. A cluster of small tubules was also observed in the posterior region of some spores. Microsporidian spores were observed in cells of the proventriculus, diverticulum and in epithelial cells of the posterior midgut. The Malpighian tubules, ileum, and rectum were heavily infected. Spores were also observed in the fat body, peripheral region of the ganglia, within and between the flight muscles, and beneath the cuticle. Although the tissues adjacent to the ovaries were heavily infected, microsporidian spores were not observed within the developing eggs. Pathogen transmission was not studied directly because it was difficult to maintain microsporidia-infected C. carnea in the laboratory. The presence of microsporidian spores in the alimentary canal suggests that the pathogen is transmitted per os and horizontal transmission may occur when infected larvae or adults are cannibalized by uninfected larvae. Molecular analysis of the microsporidian genome showed that the pathogen described in this study was 99% similar to Nosema bombycis, N. furnacalis, N. granulosis and N. spodopterae. Based on information gained during this study, we propose that the microsporidium in C. carnea be given the name Nosema chrysoperlae sp.

Meronts were found in host embryos, juveniles, and in the gonadal tissue of adults. Sporoblasts and spores were restricted to the gonad. Sporogony was disporoblastic giving rise to paired sporoblasts, which then differentiated to form spores. Spores were not found in regular groupings and there was no interfacial envelope. Spores were approximately 3.78 x 1.22 microns and had a thin exospore wall, a short polar filament, and an unusual granular polaroplast. All life cycle stages were diplokaryotic.

All life stages are unikaryotic, but analysis of the consensus small subunit region of the ribosomal gene places this microsporidium in the genus Nosema, which historically has been characterized by diplokaryotic life stages. It is also characterized by having the reversed arrangement of the ribosomal gene (LSU –ITS‐ SSU) found in species within the “true Nosema” clade. This microsporidium is apparently Holarctic in distribution. It is present in H. halys both where it is native in Asia and where it is invasive in North America, as well as in samples of North American native C. hilaris collected prior to the introduction of H. halys from Asia. Prevalence in H. halys from mid‐Atlantic, North America in 2015–2016 ranged from 0.0% to 28.3%, while prevalence in C. hilaris collected in Illinois in 1970–1972 ranged from 14.3% to 58.8%.

Structures resembling microsporidian spores were found by microscopic examination of honeybees from Uganda. Molecular confirmation failed when PCR primers specific for Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae were used, but was successful with primers covering the whole family of Nosematidae. We performed transmission electron microscopy and found typical microsporidian spores which were smaller (length: 2.36±0.14μm and width: 1.78±0.06μm; n=6) and had fewer polar filament coils (10–12) when compared to those of known species infecting honeybees. The entire 16S SSU rRNA region was amplified, cloned and sequenced and was found to be unique with the highest resemblance (97% identity) to N. apis.

The microsporidia infect eggs, all larval stages and moths of both sexes of the borer. Infection of the eggs implies that transovarial transmission occurs. Spores of constant size are produced, meronts are mainly binucleated but may contain up to eight nuclei. Presporoblastic meronts are single structures, there are no linear or colony formations. Individual diplokaryotic sporoblasts are chromophilic, and slight overstaining produces almost black spherical and oval structures. The diplokaryotic nucleus is characterized by an achromatic line less than 1 mu-m in width which divides it through its centre. This characteristic does not occur in other species of Nosema and is unique to N. partelli. It occurs through all developmental stages from the diplokaryotic sporoblast to the encysting spores. Sporogony is heralded by spindle-shaped diplokaryotic sporoblasts. Diplokaryotic sporonts decrease in size, their nuclei tend to become smaller and pyknotic, after which visible detail is lost following encystment.",fat body; Malpighian tubules; muscles; alimentary canal; egg,fat body; Malpighian tubules; muscles; alimentary canal; egg,alimentary canal; Malpighian tubules; egg; muscles; fat body,borer.,0,1,5

This microsporidium infects most body tissues of the host. N. pilicornis was compared to other microsporidian species infecting Hymenoptera and to a group of similar microsporidia infecting Lepidoptera. N. pilicornis could be distinguished from all other microsporidian species on the basis of host range and ultrastructural characteristics of the spore. Spores were oval, containing 11 to 12 polar filament coils, and the polar filament had an angle of tilt of about 80°. N. pilicornis infected lepidopteran larvae, but only when heavy spore dosages were fed to early larval instars. S. pilicornis is a good but sporadic biological control agent of common purslane, Portulaca oleracea, a pernicious weed of vegetable, ornamental, and orchard crops. N. pilicornis, which is transovarially transmitted and causes high mortality in infected larvae, affects the performance of S. pilicornis as a biological control agent.",systemic infection; midgut epithelium; Malpighian tubules; fat body (in Schizocerella pilicornis); salivary glands (in Schizocerella pilicornis); muscles (in Schizocerella pilicornis); gonads (in Schizocerella pilicornis); egg,systemic infection; midgut epithelium; Malpighian tubules; fat body; salivary glands; muscles; gonads; egg,Malpighian tubules; systemic infection; gonads; egg; muscles; midgut epithelium; salivary glands; fat body,purslane sawfly; Hymenoptera; body tissues,0,3,8

Collected in Portugal ::: A microsporidium Nosema portugal n. sp. was isolated from gypsy moths, Lymantria dispar L, collected near Lisbon, Portugal, in 1985. The Life cycle includes two sequential developmental cycles, a primary and a secondary cycle. The primary cycle occurs in midgut epithelial cells, where primary spores are produced within 48 h. The primary spores immediately extrude their polar filaments, presumably to infect other cells. In the target tissues (salivary glands and fat body) the secondary development cycle is followed by the formation of environmental spores. Primary spores were also sometimes present in target tissues. Fresh unfixed and unstained primary spores have a large posterior vacuole and measured 4.8 x 2.7 mu m. Ultrastructurally, they have 5-8 polar filament coils, a large posterior vacuole, abundant endoplasmic reticulum, and were binucleate. Mature unfixed and unstained environmental spores were highly refractive and the posterior vacuole and nuclei could not be seen through the spore coat. Fresh environmental spores measured 4.5 x 1.9 mu m. Ultrastructurally, environmental spores were binucleate, with a typical polaroplast, 10-11 isofilar polar filament coils, and a series of 4-6 thin polar filament-like tubules situated at the posterior end of the row of typical polar filament coils. The ssu rRNA sequences strongly suggest that this species is more closely related to the Vairimorpha subgroup within the Nosema/Vairimorpha clade than to the Nosema subgroup",midgut epithelium (primary spores); muscles around midgut (primary spores); silk gland (environmental spores); fat body (environmental spores),midgut epithelium; muscles around midgut; silk gland; fat body,midgut epithelium; muscles around midgut; silk gland; fat body,midgut epithelial cells; cells; polar filaments,0,3,4

The evidence suggests that although there are some differences, such as tissues affected and size of spores, the organism appears conspecific with Nosema pyrgomorphae Toguebaye, Seck & Marchand, 1988, which was described from another species of the genus Pyrgomorpha Audinet‐Serville, 1838 in Senegal.

Diplokaryotic spores were oval and measured 3.61 ± 0.29 × 1.61 ± 0.14 μM (fresh). The spore wall was composed of an electron-dense exospore and an electron-lucent endospore, ca. 30 nm and 100–120 nm thick, respectively. The polar filament was arranged in a single rank of 10–12 coils (typically 11). Microsporidian cells were found in the cytoplasm, next to the endoplasmic reticulum (especially the prespore stages) and generally surrounded by electron-lucent spaces. The infection was polyorganotropic; the fat body appeared as the most heavily invaded tissue, followed by tracheal matrix and epidermis. A molecular phylogeny based on the small (SSU) and large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA genes clearly placed the new isolate within the “Nosema bombycis clade”. Considering both SSU and LSU concatenated partial sequences, the microsporidium from R. nu showed 99.5% nucleotide similarity with N. bombycis and 99.8% with its closest relative, a microsporidium isolated from Philosamia cynthia. According to its genetic and biological features, the R. nu isolate is proposed as the new species Nosema rachiplusiae sp. n., expanding the limited knowledge on microsporidia associated to endemic South-American moths.",adipose; tracheal matrix; epidermis,adipose; tracheal matrix; epidermis,Adipose tissue; epidermis; tracheal matrix,tissue; cells; Adipose tissue; endoplasmic reticulum; electron-lucent; Rachiplusia nu larvae; DNA; epidermis; tracheal matrix,3,6,0

The life cycle of the pathogen includes the formation of quadrinucleate schizonts and sporonts that divide to form twin binucleate sporoblasts typical of the genus Nosema. The pathogen primarily invades fat and the silk and salivary glands. Larvae with heavy infections frequently develop melanized encapsulated fat lobes that are visible beneath the transparent cuticle. In laboratory tests, only the navel orangeworm and the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, acquired lethal infections. The almond moth, Cadra cautella, the raisin moth, Cadra figulilella, the tobacco moth, Ephestia elutella, and the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella, acquired benign infections.

484,Nosema tyriae,1,"Nosema tyriae n.sp. and Nosema sp., microsporidian parasites of Cinnabar moth Tyria jacobaeae ::: Nosema tyriae n.sp. was found in 63% of a population of Cinnabar moth larvae (Tyria jacobaeae). The infection was found in the gut wall, silk glands, and fat body and was probably generalized but appeared to be of low pathogenicity. Merogony and sporogony were by binary fission of diplokaryotic stages. Fresh spores were elongate, slightly pointed at the anterior end, and measured 4.7 x 2.0 microm. Ultrastructural features of special interest were 20-nm tubules connecting the surface of sporonts with host cell cytoplasm and, in the spores, a deeply domed polar sac, polaroplast consisting of closely packed longitudinally arranged membranes and loosely packed horizontally arranged membranes, and 10.5-14 coils of the polar tube in a single rank. The 16S rRNA genes of N. tyriae and Nosema bombycis from silkworms, Bombyx mori, differed by only six nucleotides and N. tyriae spores gave a moderately positive reaction with a monoclonal antibody raised to N. bombycis. N. tyriae was infective to B. mori but was less virulent than N. bombycis. However, no amplification product was obtained by PCR using N. tyriae DNA and primers considered to be specific for N. bombycis. Also, the spores of the two species are of entirely different shapes. A second diplokaryotic microsporidium, Nosema sp., found as a light infection in only one of the larvae had much smaller developmental stages and spores measuring 3.8 x 2.0 microm (fixed). Ultrastructurally it was distinguished by an abundance of dense membranes in cytoplasmic vesicles in both meronts and sporonts. Spores with up to 15 coils of the polar tube in irregular clusters or with about 12 coils in a single rank were observed in the tissues fixed from the one larva infected with this parasite. As this larva had been kept with N. tyriae-infected larvae for a few days before examination, it is possible that the two types of spores resulted from a double infection.",gut wall; silk gland; fat body; adipose tissue; systemic infection,gut wall; silk gland; fat body; adipose tissue; systemic infection,gut wall; silk gland; Adipose tissue; systemic infection,gut wall; Adipose tissue; larva,2,1,2

(Lepidoptera: Geometridae) ::: Two species of stored product pests, Ptinus pusillus and P. Brunneus which were collected in watermills, and later reared in laboratory, became infected by two protozoan parasites, a coccidian Adelina tribolii comb. nov. And a microsporidian Nosema ptinidorum n. sp. Both parasites invade the fat body of adults of host-animals. The larvae remained free from infection. The two new pathogens are described and pictured. This is the first report on coccidian and microsporidian parasites found in stored product pests of the Family Ptinidae, Coleoptera.Three species of microsporidia from a population of winter moths, Operophtera brumata (L.), were examined by light microscopy. Pleistophora operophterae (Canning, 1960) is redescribed. The stages with one or two nuclei which were originally termed presporonts are now interpreted as fragments of disrupted vacuolated sporonts or prematuraly separated sporoblasts. The range of spore numbers within sporophorous vesicles is modified to 4 to c.60, rather than 10 to c.100. This species cannot be retained in the genus Pleistophora Gurley, 1893, redefined by Canning & Nicholas (1980), but ultrastructural studies are required before taxonomic reassignment is attempted. Nosema operophterae Canning, 1960 is also redescribed. Merogony consists mainly of binary fission of binucleate and tetranucleate stages but large irregular-shaped multinucleate meronts were also present. Ribbon-shaped sporonts with two, four or eight linearly-spaced nuclei give rise, via binucleate segments, to chains of uninucleate sporoblasts. The species is transferred to a new genus Orthosoma n.g. as Orthosoma operophterae (Canning, 1960) since its isolated nuclei and polysporoblastic sporogony are not characteristic of the genus Nosema Nägeli, 1857. The third species Nosema operophterae Purrini & Skatulla, 1979 is renamed N. wistmansi nom.nov. because the name given by Purrini & Skatulla was preoccupied and is now a synonym of O. operophterae. Details of the developmental stages of N. wistmansi are given, which show that it is typical of the genus Nosema, with nuclei in diplokaryon arrangement and with disporoblastic sporogony. All species are shown to have stages in the eggs of their hosts, which are thought to play a part in generation to generation transmission.",oocytes,oocytes,oocytes,watermills; fat body,0,2,1

(Microsporidia), parasite of enterocytes of Nothobranchius rubripinnis ::: A new intranuclear microsporidium, Nucleospora secunda n.sp., infecting intestinal epithelial cells of Nothobranchius rubripinnis Seegers, 1986, is described. Developmental stages and spores are isolated from one another in the karyoplasm. Merogony proceeds from simple uninucleate meronts to multinucleate meronts. Transformation into sporogonial plasmodia is marked by the appearance of ellipsoidal dark bodies, comparable to polar tube precursors, which later coalesce to form the turns of the polar tube. Primordia of the extrusion apparatus are already established in the plasmodium before it starts to cleave into separate sporoblasts. Ellipsoidal mature spores are of average size 1.6 x 0.8 m and have 4 to 5 turns of the polar tube. The polaroplast consists of an outer region of closely spaced lamellae, enclosing a region of widely spaced lamellae or loose flat cisternae. Tubular inclusions appear in the karyoplasm of infected nuclei.",intestinal epithelium,intestinal epithelium,intestinal epithelium,Nucleospora secunda n. sp.; nuclei; intestinal epithelial cells; enterocytes; intranuclear; karyoplasm; Nothobranchius rubripinnis,0,7,1

(Microspora, Thelohaniidae), a Microsporidian Parasite of the Dragon Fly Coenagrion hastulatum in Sweden ::: The microsporidium Nudispora biformis n. g., n. sp., a parasite of a larva of the damsel fly Coenagrion hastulatum in Sweden, is described based on light microscopic and ultrastructural characteristics. Merogonial stages and sporonts are diplokaryotic. Sporogony comprises meiotic and mitotic divisions, and finally eight monokaryotic sporoblasts are released from a lobed plasmodium. Sporophorous vesicles are not formed. The monokaryotic spores are oval, measuring 1.4–1.8 × 2.8–3.4 μm in living condition. The thick spore wall has a layered exospore, with a median double‐layer. The polaroplast has two lamellar parts, with the closest packed lamellae anteriorly. The isofilar polar filament is arranged in 6 (to 7) coils in the posterior half of the spore. Laminar and tubular extracellular material of exospore construction is present in the proximity of sporogonial stages. In addition to normal spores teratological spores are produced. The microsporidium is compared to the microsporidia of the Odonata; its possible relations to the genus Pseudothelohania and to the Thelohania‐like microsporidia are discussed.

The ultrastructure of this new species is presented together with the first molecular characterization for a microsporidium of mites. All stages of this new microsporidium are haplokaryotic and develop in direct contact with the host-cell cytoplasm. Sporogony is disporoblastic and spores are formed in eggs, immature stages, and adults of M. occidentalis. There are two morphological classes of spores, one with a short polar filament (3–5 coils) that measured m and one with a longer polar filament (8–9 coils) that measured m. Horizontal transmission of this new species occurs by cannibalism of eggs and other stages and perhaps involves the spores with the long polar filament. Spores with the short polar filament may play a role in autoinfection and vertical (transovarial) transmission that is highly efficient in transferring the microsporidium from adults to progeny. Analysis of the small subunit ribosomal DNA indicated that this species from M. occidentalis is most closely related to the Nosema/Vairimorpha clade of microsporidia. A conflict between the morphological and molecular data is discussed. The species is compared to previously described microsporidia of arachnids resulting in creation of Oligosporidium occidentalis n. sp. in the family Unikaryonidae. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.",egg; ovarian; intestinal; muscle; epithelium,egg; ovarian; intestinal; muscle; epithelium,muscle; intestinal; ovarian; egg; epithelium,Oligosporidium occidentalis n. sp.,0,1,5

(Microspora, Ordosporidae fam. nov.), a new microsporidian parasite of Daphnia magna (Crustacea, Cladocera) ::: The new microsporidium Ordospora colligata gen. et sp. n. is described with emphasis on the ultrastructural characteristics. The parasite, which is superficially similar to Glugoides intestinalis (Chatton, 1907), invades the gut epithelium of Daphnia magna, where the complete development takes place in a host cell-derived parasitophorous vacuole. Merogonial and sporogonial stages occur together in the vacuole, with presporal stages at the periphery, mature spores aggregated in the centre. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. Merogonial plasmodia are initially rounded, later elongated, and they give rise to four merozoites. The bouts of merogony are unknown. The sporont produces two sporoblast mother cells, which often remain coupled. Each cell generates a chain of four sporoblasts. Sporophorous vesicles are not produced. Mature spores are pyriform with a pointed anterior pole and with an obliquely positioned posterior vacuole. Unfixed spores measure 1.33-2.29 x 2.32-3.69 μm. The exospore is uniform, about 11 nm thick. The polar filament is isofilar, 82-85 nm wide, making 5-6 coils in the posterior half of the spore. The polaroplast is uniform, composed of about 28 nm, wide lamellar components, where the lamellae are folded around each other. The discrimination from other microsporidian species and the systematic position are briefly discussed.

511,Ovipleistophora arlo,1,"Evidence for trophic transfer of Inodosporus octospora and Ovipleistophora arlo n. sp. (Microsporidia) between crustacean and fish hosts ::: Within aquatic habitats, the hyper-abundant Order Crustacea appear to be the predominant host group for members of the Phylum Microsporidia. The musculature, a common site of infection, provides access to biochemical (carbohydrate-rich) and physiological (mitochondria-rich) conditions conducive to prolific parasite replication and maturation. The significant proportion of body plan devoted to skeletal musculature in Crustacea provides the location for a highly efficient intracellular parasite factory. In this study, we utilize histological, ultrastructural and phylogenetic evidence to describe a previously known (Inodosporus octospora) and novel (Ovipleistophora arlo n. sp.) microsporidian parasites infecting the musculature of the common prawn (Palaemon serratus) from the same site, at the same time of year. Despite similar clinical signs of infection, both parasites are otherwise distinct in terms of pathogenesis, morphology and phylogeny. Based upon partial subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rDNA) sequence, we show that that I. octospora may be identical to a Kabatana sp. previously described infecting two-spot goby (Gobiusculus flavescens) in Europe, or at least that Inodosporus and Kabatana genera are synonyms. In addition, SSU rDNA sequence for O. arlo places it within a distinct clade containing Ovipleistophora mirandellae and Ovipleistophora ovariae, both infecting the oocytes of freshwater fish in Europe. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence for trophic-transfer between crustacean and fish hosts for two different microsporidians within clade 5 of the phylum. Furthermore, it demonstrates that morphologically and phylogenetically distinct microsporidians can infect the same tissues of the same host species to impart clinical signs which mimic infection with the other.",Skeletal musculature of abdomen and thorax,Skeletal musculature of abdomen and thorax,Set of muscles,oocytes; tissues; two-spot; Set of muscles; ribosomal,1,4,0
514,Pancytospora epiphaga,1,"A Large Collection of Novel Nematode-Infecting Microsporidia and Their Diverse Interactions with Caenorhabditis elegans and Other Related Nematodes ::: Microsporidia are fungi-related intracellular pathogens that may infect virtually all animals, but are poorly understood. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has recently become a model host for studying microsporidia through the identification of its natural microsporidian pathogen Nematocida parisii. However, it was unclear how widespread and diverse microsporidia infections are in C. elegans or other related nematodes in the wild. Here we describe the isolation and culture of 47 nematodes with microsporidian infections. N. parisii is found to be the most common microsporidia infecting C. elegans in the wild. In addition, we further describe and name six new species in the Nematocida genus. Our sampling and phylogenetic analysis further identify two subclades that are genetically distinct from Nematocida, and we name them Enteropsectra and Pancytospora. Interestingly, unlike Nematocida, these two genera belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens. All of these microsporidia are horizontally transmitted and most specifically infect intestinal cells, except Pancytospora epiphaga that replicates mostly in the epidermis of its Caenorhabditis host. At the subcellular level in the infected host cell, spores of the novel genus Enteropsectra show a characteristic apical distribution and exit via budding off of the plasma membrane, instead of exiting via exocytosis as spores of Nematocida. Host specificity is broad for some microsporidia, narrow for others: indeed, some microsporidia can infect Oscheius tipulae but not its sister species Oscheius sp. 3, and conversely some microsporidia found infecting Oscheius sp. 3 do not infect O. tipulae. We also show that N. ausubeli fails to strongly induce in C. elegans the transcription of genes that are induced by other Nematocida species, suggesting it has evolved mechanisms to prevent induction of this host response. Altogether, these newly isolated species illustrate the diversity and ubiquity of microsporidian infections in nematodes, and provide a rich resource to investigate host-parasite coevolution in tractable nematode hosts.",epidermis,epidermis,epidermis,intestinal cells; epidermis,1,1,0

519,Parahepatospora carcini,1,"Parahepatospora carcini n. gen., n. sp., a parasite of invasive Carcinus maenas with intermediate features of sporogony between the Enterocytozoon clade and other microsporidia ::: Parahepatospora carcini n. gen. n. sp., is a novel microsporidian parasite discovered infecting the cytoplasm of epithelial cells of the hepatopancreas of a single Carcinus maenas specimen. The crab was sampled from within its invasive range in Atlantic Canada (Nova Scotia). Histopathology and transmission electron microscopy were used to show the development of the parasite within a simple interfacial membrane, culminating in the formation of unikaryotic spores with 5–6 turns of an isofilar polar filament. Formation of a multinucleate meront (>12 nuclei observed) preceded thickening and invagination of the plasmodial membrane, and in many cases, formation of spore extrusion precursors (polar filaments, anchoring disk) prior to complete separation of pre-sporoblasts from the sporogonial plasmodium. This developmental feature is intermediate between the Enterocytozoonidae (formation of spore extrusion precursors within the sporont plasmodium) and all other Microsporidia (formation of spore extrusion precursors after separation of sporont from the sporont plasmodium). SSU rRNA-based gene phylogenies place P. carcini within microsporidian Clade IV, between the Enterocytozoonidae and the so-called Enterocytospora-clade, which includes Enterocytospora artemiae and Globulispora mitoportans. Both of these groups contain gut-infecting microsporidians of aquatic invertebrates, fish and humans. According to morphological and phylogenetic characters, we propose that P. carcini occupies a basal position to the Enterocytozoonidae.

The larvae were maintained under laboratory conditions in salt concentrations of 10 g/l and 20 g/l of water. Daily recordings of the mortality of the larvae were made and the dates of change of instar were noted. Infected larvae were processed for transmission electronic microscopy using conventional methods at pH 7.2 and 260 mOsm/l. The infection by the microsporidia was positively correlated with an increase in the mean duration of the fourth instar of 2.88 to 6.33 days in 10 g/l of salt and of 2.47 to 6.14 days in 20 g/l of salt. Larval mortality also increased by approximately 50% during this instar in both salt concentrations. Development time and survival were not affected during the other immature stages. The mature spores found in the intestines of infected larvae were barrel shaped and measured approximately 2.6 x 2.4 mm. The exospore has a collar shaped prolongation at the posterior end of the spore. The spores are uninuclear with a posterior vacuole. The polar filament is anisofilar with nine rings, five with a diameter of 58 nm each and four with a diameter of 23 nm each. The polarplast is lamellate, and more tightly packed in the apical region. The reduction of the survival of A. aquasalis larvae infected with the microsporidia, and the increase in the development time suggest that this parasite might have a potential as a biological control of this pest. The microsporidium described here has similar characteristics to that of the genus Parathelohania.

The spores of Pe. moriokae had an average size of 1.0 × 3.8 µm and 1.3 × 3.2 µm in the intestine and hypodermis, respectively, and electron microscopy revealed that they exhibited distinguishing features with morphological diversity in the hypodermis. Isolated spores were able to infect a reference strain of O. tipulae (CEW1) through horizontal transmission but not the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Upon infection, the spores were first observed in the hypodermis and then in the intestine the following day, suggesting a unique infectious route among nematode-infective microsporidia. Molecular phylogenetic analysis grouped this new species with the recently identified nematode-infective parasites Enteropsectra and Pancytospora forming a monophyletic sister clade to Orthosomella in clade IV, which also includes human pathogens such as Enterocytozoon and Vittaforma.

(Microsporidia, Pleistophoridae) from Pagrus pagrus in Egypt ::: The spore morphology and molecular systematic of a new microsporidian which was isolated from the common sea bream Pagrus pagrus (F: Sparidae Linnaeus, 1758) from the Red Sea, Egypt have been studied. Fifty-six out of 300 (18.7 %) of this fish were infected with microsporidian parasites. The infection was appeared as whitish, ellipsoid, round, or elongated nodules embedded in the epithelial lining of the peritoneum and also in the intestinal epithelium. Light microscopic study revealed that nodules were encapsulated by a fibrous layer encircling numerous mature spores measuring 1.7 ± 0.6 (1.5–2.7 μm) × 1.5 ± 0.3 μm (1.2–1.8 μm) in size. Ultrastructure of spores was characteristic for the genus Pleistophora: dimorphic, uninucleate spores (each spore possesses three to five polar filament coils) and a posterior vacuole. Also, the early recognizable stages of the parasite within nodules include uninucleated, binucleated, and multinucleated meronts followed by detachment of the plasmalemma of the sporont producing sporoblasts which mature to spores that consist of a spore coat and spore contents. Also, we analyzed the small subunit ribosomal gene (SSUrDNA) using PCR and sequencing specimens from the marine populations of P. pagrus fish from the Red Sea. From blast searches, sequence analysis, and phylogenetic analysis, we did not find corresponding GenBank entries to our species. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences showed that the sequence of our microsporidium was most similar to five Pleistophora species with degrees of identity (>91.5 %). It was most similar (97.8 % identity) to that of Pleistophora hyphessobryconis (account no. GU126672) differing in 19 nucleotide positions and with lower divergence value, Pleistophora ovariae (96.2 % identity, account no.

562,Pleistophora ronneafiei,1,"Ultrastructure and Development of Pleistophora ronneafiei n. sp., a Microsporidium (Protista) in the Skeletal Muscle of an Immune-Compromised Individual ::: ABSTRACT. This report provides a detailed ultrastructural study of the life cycle, including proliferative and sporogonic developmental stages, of the first Pleistophora species (microsporidium) obtained from an immune-incompetent patient. In 1985, the organism obtained from a muscle biopsy was initially identified as belonging to the genus Pleistophora, based on spore morphology and its location in a sporophorous vesicle. Since that initial report, at least two new microsporidial genera, Trachipleistophora and Brachiola, have been reported to infect the muscle tissue of immunologically compromised patients. Because Trachipleistophora development is similar to Pleistophora, and as Pleistophora was only known to occur in cold-blooded hosts, the question of the proper classification of this microsporidium arose. The information acquired in this study makes it possible to compare Pleistophora sp. (Ledford et al. 1985) to the known human infections and properly determine its correct taxonomic position. Our ultrastructural data have revealed the formation of multinucleate sporogonial plasmodia, a developmental characteristic of the genus Pleistophora and not Trachipleistophora. A comparison with other species of the genus supports the establishment of a new species.

The development cycle of this species is described by light and electron microscopy. Meronts are rounded plasmodia dividing by plasmotomy and bounded by an amorphous and very regular wall. At the onset of sporogony, sporophorous vesicles are formed by separation of the plasma membrane from the external wall which then becomes a characteristic mesh. Mature spores (4.45 × 2.37μm) are ovoid and slightly pyriform with a large posterior vacuole.",intestines (muscularis in gut wall),intestines,Intestines,muscularis; Sparus aurata; gilt-head sea bream; Intestines; Sparus aurata L.,1,4,0

PARASITOS EN SIMULIDOS DE LOS ANDES COLOMBIANOS ::: We describe the ultrastructure of two microsporidia parasites of simuliids of the region of La Calera (2.950 m alt.), near Bogotá. Polydispyrenia simulii was found infecting larvae of Simulium ignescens and Polydispyrenia norandina sp. nov., infecting a larva of Gigantodax ortizi. The two species present large number of spores aggregated within a sporophoric vesicle, characteristic of the family Pleistophoridae. Polydispyrenia simulii, a cosmopolitan parasite of simuliid larvae, has until now been the only known species of this genus. Two ultrastructural characters permit identification of this species: a) Presence of peculiar cylindrical structures surrounding the sporoblasts in the cavity of the sporophoric vesicle (episporontal space); in cross section these structures look like thick-walled rings: b) Consistently 5-6 coils of the polar filament inside the mature spore.

(Microsporidia, Tetramicridae), a parasite infecting the freshwater fish Aequidens plagiozonatus (Teleostei, Cichlidae) from Brazil ::: Morphological and molecular procedures were used to describe a new species of microsporidian that infects the muscles of the sub-opercular region and the caudal fins of the freshwater Aequidens plagiozonatus in Brazil. This microsporidian forms whitish xenomas containing variable number of spores, reaching up to ~0.4 mm in diameter. The mature spores, pyriformin shape, with slightly round ends, measured 3.4 ± 0.5 μm long and 1.9 ± 0.3 μm wide (n = 50) and showed characteristics typical of Microsporidia. The average thickness of the spore wall was 100 (96–108) nm (n = 50), and the spore wall was composed of two layers, a thin, electron-dense exospore and a thick electron-transparent endospore. The exospore was surrounded by a thin, irregular layer of granular material. The anchoring disc was mushroom-like, located in the apical region of the spore in an eccentric position relative to the spore axis, rendering bilateral asymmetry to the spore. The anterior part of the polar filament (PF) (manubrium) measured approximately 125 (122–128) nm thick (n = 30), and the angle of tilt between the anterior PF and the spore axis was ~45°; the posterior part was packed in 8–9 coils. Phylogenetic analysis showed a strongly supported clade containing family Spragueidae Weissenberg, 1976, family Tetramicridae Matthews and Matthews, 1980, Microsporidium sp. RBS1, and Kabatana spp. In conclusion, the available morphological, ultrastructural, and molecular data shows that this microsporidian is a new species belonging to group 4, classified as Potaspora aequidens n. sp.

Morphological, ultrastructural and molecular characterization ::: SUMMARY A fish-infecting Microsporidia Potaspora morhaphis n. gen., n. sp. found adherent to the wall of the coelomic cavity of the freshwater fish, Potamorhaphis guianensis, from lower Amazon River is described, based on light microscope and ultrastructural characteristics. This microsporidian forms whitish xenomas distinguished by the numerous filiform and anastomosed microvilli. The xenoma was completely filled by several developmental stages. In all of these stages, the nuclei are monokaryotic and develop in direct contact with host cell cytoplasm. The merogonial plasmodium divides by binary fission and the disporoblastic pyriform spores of sporont origin measure 2·8±0·3×1·5±0·2 μm. In mature spores the polar filament was arranged into 9–10 coils in 2 layers. The polaroplast had 2 distinct regions around the manubrium and an electron-dense globule was observed. The small subunit, intergenic space and partial large subunit rRNA gene were sequenced and maximum parsimony analysis placed the microsporidian described here in the clade that includes the genera Kabatana, Microgemma, Spraguea and Tetramicra. The ultrastructural morphology of the xenoma, and the developmental stages including the spores of this microsporidian parasite, as well as the phylogenetic analysis, suggest the erection of a new genus and species.",intestinal,intestinal,intestinal,coelomic cavity; wall,0,2,1

However, many of these pathogens are known only from molecular-based studies. We provide ultrastructural data supported by molecular phylogeny for a common microsporidium infecting the Daphnia longispina complex, important planktonic filter-feeders in reservoirs and ponds in the temperate Holarctic region. This parasite, previously characterized only by molecular means, infects adipose cells around the Daphnia midgut and eventually fills the centre of the host body with ovoid-shaped spores. A new microsporidian genus and species belonging to the Agglomeratidae superclade is described as Pseudoberwaldia daphniae gen. et sp. nov. Molecular data indicate its widespread presence in Central European reservoirs (reported as isolate “MIC1”) but also in Swedish coastal rockpools (“Ängskärs-klubben”). The most closely related lineage was reported from a caddisfly larva; we thus speculate that this taxon may have an insect secondary host in its life cycle. Morphological characterization and differential diagnosis of most commonly encountered microsporidian taxa infecting hosts in the D. longispina complex in Europe opens new possibilities for studies of their ecological and evolutionary interactions.",infects adipose cells around the Daphnia,infects adipose cells around the Daphnia,adipose cells,adipose cells; Daphnia midgut,1,1,0
574,Pseudokabatana alburnus,1,"Pseudokabatana alburnus n. gen. n. sp., (Microsporidia) from the liver of topmouth culter Culter alburnus (Actinopterygii, Cyprinidae) from China ::: We describe the type species of a novel genus of microsporidian parasite, Pseudokabatana alburnus n. gen. n. sp., infecting the liver of topmouth culter, Culter alburnus Basilewsky, 1855, from Lake Poyang off Xingzi county, Jiangxi Province, China. The parasite elicits formation of spherical xenomas of up to 1.2 mm in diameter containing all observed life stages from early merogonal plasmodia to mature spores contained within the cytoplasm of host hepatocytes. Merogonal plasmodia existed in direct contact with the host cytoplasm and contained up to 20 visible nuclei. Plasmotomy of the multinucleate plasmodium led to formation of uninucleate cells in which the nucleus underwent further division to form bi-nucleate presporonts, sporonts (defined by cells with a thickened endospore) and eventually sporoblasts (containing pre-cursors of the spore extrusion apparatus). Mature spores were pyriform and monokaryotic, measuring 2.3 ± 0.19 μm long and 1.3 ± 0.10 μm wide. Spores possessed a bipartite polaroplast and 5–6 coils of a polar filament, in a single rank. The obtained partial SSU rRNA gene sequence, 1383 bp in length, did not match any of microsporidia available in GenBank. SSU rDNA-based phylogenetic analysis indicated a new taxon branching with Kabatana rondoni, a parasite infecting the skeletal muscle of Gymnorhamphichthys rondoni from the Amazon River. Due to different host and tissue tropism, the novel taxon did not fit the diagnostic criteria for the genus Kabatana. Further, based on SSU rDNA-inferred phylogenetic analyses, different ultrastructural features of developmental stages, and ecological considerations, a new genus Pseudokabatana and type species Pseudokabatana alburnus n. sp. was erected for the parasite in topmouth culter.",Hepatocytes of Liver,Hepatocytes of Liver,Hepatocytes,liver; skeletal muscle,0,2,1
575,Pseudoloma neurophilia,1,"Pseudoloma neurophilia n. g., n. sp., a new microsporidium from the central nervous system of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) ::: An unusual xenoma-forming microsporidium was discovered in the central nervous system of moribund zebrafish from a laboratory colony in Eugene, Oregon. Infected fish were often emaciated and lethargic, and histological examination commonly revealed severe myelitis and myositis associated with the infection. Based on its structure, development, and small subunit ribosomal DNA sequence it is unique among fish microsporidia. Spores are uninucleate, ovoid to pyriform, with a prominent posterior vacuole. Spores average 5.4 × 2.7 μm with 13-16 coils of the polar filament. The microsporidium produces xenomas within the spinal cord and hindbrain of fish, and xenomas contained sporophorous vesicles with up to 16 spores. Sporoblasts and presporoblast stages (probably sporonts) are found occasionally in small aggregates dispersed randomly throughout xenomas. It clustered in the ""Ichthyosporidium group"" along with other fish microsporidian genera based on rDNA sequence analysis. The rDNA sequence of the zebrafish microsporidium was most similar to that of Ichthyosporidium, but showed only 12.1% similarity and therefore this microsporidium can be considered a distinct genus and species, which we have named Pseudoloma neurophilia n. g., n. sp.",nervous,nervous,nervous,sporonts,0,1,1

Merogonial and sporogonial stages are diplokaryotic. Sporogony is disporoblastic. The spores are cylindrical, often slightly curved and wider in the mid-region, 1.8–2.1 × 8.1–14.2 um long in fixed and stained condition. The spore wall has a ca. 43 mm thick, uniform exospore. The polaroplast has an anterior part with compressed lamellae and a posterior section with 53–128 nm wide tubules. The polar filament has a 181–283 nm wide, straight, short, anterior section in the centre of the spore, an oblique section with tapering diameter, and a long, posterior, 119–178 nm wide section, arranged in (10−)12(−13) isofilar coils, close to the spore wall in the posterior half of the spore. The most anterior and most posterior coils are irregularly arranged, the median coils form a close, regular group. The angle of tilt of the most anterior, regularly arranged coil is ca. 55°. The transversely sectioned filament has distinct concentrical layers of variable thickness and electron density. The diplokaryon occupies the centre of the spore. Sporophorous vesicle absent, but a folded, ca. 16 nm thick envelope, resembling a sporophorous vesicle, is formed by delamination of exospore material. Teratological sporogony was observed. The microsporidium is compared to microsporidia of the genera Bacillidium, Jirovecia and Hrabyeia.

(Bryozoa: Phylactolaemata) ::: Abstract. The development of a new species of microsporidian, infecting a freshwater Plumatellid bryozoan, is described. The small-subunit rDNA, internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), and partial large-subunit rDNA genes were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the parasite clustered with Schroedera plumatellae. However, while there were morphological affinities with this species, significant differences were also observed. The infection initially appeared as a roughening of the peritoneum lining the metacoelom of the bryozoan. This roughening resolved into meront-infected syncytia, composed of interconnected cells of the body wall that detached to float in the coleomic cavity. Spores were observed to develop within these syncytia. All stages of development were diplokaryotic in contrast to S. plumatellae, which has a distinct monokaryotic merogony preceding sporogony. The infection was pathogenic to the host. Direct bryozoan–bryozoan transmission was not observed.

582,Sporanauta perivermis,1,"Microsporidian Infection in a Free-Living Marine Nematode ::: Microsporidia are unicellular fungi that are obligate endoparasites. Although nematodes are one of the most abundant and diverse animal groups, the only confirmed report of microsporidian infection was that of the “nematode killer” (Nematocida parisii). N. parisii was isolated from a wild Caenorhabditis sp. and causes an acute and lethal intestinal infection in a lab strain of Caenorhabditis elegans. We set out to characterize a microsporidian infection in a wild nematode to determine whether the infection pattern of N. parisii in the lab is typical of microsporidian infections in nematodes. We describe a novel microsporidian species named Sporanauta perivermis (marine spore of roundworms) and characterize its infection in its natural host, the free-living marine nematode Odontophora rectangula. S. perivermis is not closely related to N. parisii and differs strikingly in all aspects of infection. Examination by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the infection was localized in the hypodermal and muscle tissues only and did not involve the intestines. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed infection in the muscle and hypodermis, and surprisingly, it also revealed that the parasite infects O. rectangula eggs, suggesting a vertical mode of transmission. Our observations highlight the importance of studying parasites in their natural hosts and indicate that not all nematode-infecting microsporidia are “nematode killers”; instead, microsporidiosis can be more versatile and chronic in the wild.",Hypoderm (adults); muscles (adults); egg (adult female); and the reproductive tissues of juveniles,Hypoderm; muscles; egg; and the reproductive tissues of juveniles,tissues; Hypoderm; egg; muscles,spore; Hypoderm; muscle,1,2,3
586,Takaokaspora nipponicus,1,"Morphological and molecular characterization of a microsporidian parasite, Takaokaspora nipponicus n. gen., n. sp. from the invasive rock pool mosquito, Ochlerotatus japonicus japonicus ::: Graphical abstract Highlights • A new genus and species of Microsporidia is described from mosquitoes. • The microsporidium is vertically and horizontally transmitted and exhibits dimorphic development. • Development in vertically-infected larvae is fatal and results in the formation of uninucleate conical spores. • Horizontal transmission occurs via oral ingestion of spores produced in vertically-infected larvae. • The SSU rDNA sequence of the microsporidium is unique from all other mosquito-parasitic species. Abstract A new genus and species of Microsporidia, Takaokaspora nipponicus n. gen., n. sp. is described from Ochlerotatus japonicus japonicus (Theobald) and Ochlerotatus hatorii (Yamada) based on light microscope and ultrastructural morphology, developmental features, transmission cycles and comparative sequence analyses of the small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA). The microsporidium is both vertically and horizontally transmitted, exhibits dimorphic development alternating between diplokaryotic and monokaryotic stages and produces two morphologically distinct spores, one in larvae and another in adult females. Horizontal transmission of infection to larval mosquitoes occurs via direct oral ingestion of uninucleate spores that are produced in vertically-infected larval hosts. Development in horizontally-infected hosts is diplokaryotic following karyokinesis of uninucleate schizonts and binary fission to produce small (4.3μm×2.0μm) membrane free, ovoid, binucleate spores that are confined to adult female reproductive tissues (ovariole sheath and oviducts). Vertical transmission of the microsporidium from adult females to larval progeny takes place via surface contamination of the egg (transovum). Microsporidian development in vertically-infected larvae is haplophasic with unpaired nuclei throughout, producing rosette-shaped sporogonial plasmodia contained within a thin non-persistent sporophorous vesicle and culminating in the formation of membrane free, uninucleate, conical spores (7.0μm×2.8μm). Development is confined to host fat body tissue which appears as swollen white masses in the thorax and selected segments of the abdomen causing larvae to appear abnormally distorted and results in death during the third and fourth instar stages. The SSU rDNA sequences obtained from the two morphologically identical microsporidia isolated from Oc. j. japonicus and Oc. hatorii were nearly identical and unique when compared with GenBank entries of all other mosquito-parasitic species. Phylogenetic trees constructed by Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and bootstrap analyses using the Neighbor Joining search parameter yielded similar typologies. In each case, the novel microsporidium was the sister group to the clade containing Parathelohania species from Anopheles mosquitoes and the monotypic Novothelohania ovalae from Ochlerotatus caspius showing approximately 10–13% sequence divergence to those two genera providing strong support for establishment as a separate genus.",adipose of larvae (vertical trans.); gonads (of horizontally-infected adult female hosts),adipose of larvae; gonads,gonads; Adipose tissue,thorax; abdomen; Adipose tissue; ribosomal DNA,1,3,1

All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. The sporogony is polysporoblastic, yielding 16–32 spores. The spores are rod-shaped, 1.3–1.4 × 3.7–4.2 μm in living condition. The spore wall has a 34–40 nm thick, layered exospore, with a median layer resembling a unit membrane. The endospore is thicker than the exospore. The polaroplast has two lamellar parts, where the posterior lamellae are the widest. The isofilar, 128–149 nm thick polar filament is arranged in 9–10 coils in a single layer close to the spore wall in the posterior 2/3 of the spore. The angle of tilt is c. 45°. The transversely sectioned polar filament has distinct concentrical layers of variable thickness and electron density. Sporophorous vesicles are ellipsoid and fragile. The thin electron-dense envelope is initiated as narrow tubulus-like promordia, appearing when the nucleus of the sporont has divided once. The episporontal space of vesicles with sporogonial plasmodia is devoid of inclusions. Vesicles with sporoblasts and spores have tubular exospore-derived inclusions of two dimensions. The new genus is compared to genera with polysporoblastic sporogony in sporophorous vesicles, primarily to Cystosporogenes and Flabelliforma.

Sporulation stages were studied with the light and the electron microscope. Earliest stages were small and apparently uninucleate. Next were small diplokaryotic cells that possibly arose by fusion of the former. These enlarged and underwent sporogony. Sporogony was a series of three binary divisions, each producing unikaryotic cells. There was no sporogonial plasmodium. The spore was ovoid, 4.8 × 3.1 μm (stained), with a large crescentic nucleus and rounded posterior vacuole. The polar filament was isofilar, doubly coiled, with about 10 turns. This species closely resembles the type T. giardi Henneguy.

(Protozoa: Microsporidia) ::: Trachipleistophora anthropophthera n. sp., was found at autopsy in the brain of one and in the brain, kidneys, pancreas, thyroid, parathyroid, heart, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow of a second patient with AIDS. The parasite is similar to the recently described T. hominis Hollister, Canning, Weidner, Field, Kench and Marriott, 1996, in having isolated nuclei, meronts with a thick layer of electron dense material on the outer face of their plasmalemma and sporogony during which spores are formed inside a thick-walled sporophorous vesicle. In contrast to T. hominis, this species is dimorphic as it forms two kinds of sporophorous vesicles and spores: Type I - round to oval polysporous sporophorous vesicle, 7-10 μm in size, usually with eight spores (3.7 x 2.0 μm), thick endospores, subterminal anchoring disc and anisofilar polar filaments forming seven thicker and two thinner terminal coils. This type of sporophorous vesicle is associated with 25-30 nm filaments extending into the host cell cytoplasm. Type II - smaller, bisporous sporophorous vesicle (4-5 x 2.2-2.5 μm) with two, nearly round, thin-walled spores, 2.2-2.5 x 1.8-2.0 μm in size, having 4-5 isofilar coils.

J. Clin. Pathol. 106: 535-43, 1996) (hereafter referred to as HMY) was investigated by light and transmission electron microscopy and compared with Thelohania apodemi Doby, Jeannes et Raoult, 1963, a microsporidian of small rodents. The fine structure of the HMY was found to be similar to that of Trachipleistophora hominis Hollister, Canning, Weldner, Field, Kench et Marriott, 1996. Characteristic is the presence of a thick layer of electron dense material on the outer face of the meront plasmalemma, which is maintained during the whole life cycle and which later persists as an electron dense coat on the sporophorous vesicle (SPOV). However, HMY is distinguished from T. hominis during sporogony, as two types of SPOV and spores are formed in HMY. One type of SPOV contains thick-walled spores (usually 8 or more in number) with anisofilar polar filaments of 7 + 2 pattern, while the other type contains only two thin-walled spores with a smaller number (3-5) of isofilar polar filament coils. The HMY differs from T. apodemi which also forms SPOV with 8 spores inside, but the spores of which are larger in size and have 9 + 2 polar filament pattern.",brain; kidney,brain; kidney,brain; kidney,Am.,0,1,2

Sporogony occurred only in follicle cells adjacent to developing oocytes and was in synchrony with the process of vitellogenesis. Oocytes were infected after formation of intracellular connections with follicle cells but harboured only vegetative stages of the parasite. Parasites were associated with the perinuclear cytoplasm and, in developing embryos, segregated to daughter cells along the axis of the spindle. In juvenile animals there was no evidence of pathology linked with feminization and the parasite was found at low density in cells under the cuticle.

A survey conducted on A. pallipes complex populations in Northern Italy highlighted the presence of two different microsporidia causing similar muscular lesions, T. contejeani and an undescribed octosporoblastic species Vairimorpha austropotamobii sp. nov. Mature spores and earlier developmental stages of V. austropotamobii sp. nov. were found within striated muscle cells of the thorax, abdomen, and appendages of the crayfish. Only octosporoblastic sporogony within sporophorous vesicles (SPVs) was observed. Diplokaryotic sporonts separated into two uninucleate daughter cells, which gave rise to a rosette-shaped plasmodium, and eight uninucleate spores were produced within the persistent SPV. Ultrastructural features of stages in the octosporoblastic sequence were similar to those described for Vairimorpha necatrix, the type species.

Meanwhile, the silkworm eggs produced by the infected moths were examined using a microscope and PCR amplification. Neither spores nor the expected PCR band were observed, suggesting that no vertical transmission occurred in Bombyx mori. In addition, the ultrastructure of the isolate was studied by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Two types of spores were observed: diplokaroytic spores with 13–17 coils of polar tubes and monokaryotic spores with less coils of polar tubes which could form octospores; however, no sporophorous vesicles were observed. Finally, phylogenetic analysis of the small subunit rRNA genes of Vairimorpha species showed that this isolate has a closer relationship to Vairimorpha necatrix than the other species studied. This result also is supported by phylogenetic analysis based on their actin genes, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and RNA polymerase II (RPB1). Based on the information gained during this study, we propose that this microsporidian species infecting B. mori should be given the name V. necatrix BM.",midgut; Malpighian tubules; fat body; silk glands; muscles; testis,midgut; Malpighian tubules; fat body; silk glands; muscles; testis,Malpighian tubules; testis; silk glands; midgut; muscles; fat body,BM,0,1,6
681,Vairimorpha ocinarae,1,"A new microsporidian species, Vairimorpha ocinarae n. sp., isolated from Ocinara lida Moore (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) in Taiwan ::: Abstract A new microsporidium was isolated from Ocinara lida Moore (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae), a pest of Ficus microcarpa L. f. in Taiwan. The microsporidium produces systemic infections in O. lida larvae; the midgut epithelium, Malpighian tubules, and midgut muscle tissues were the target tissues for this isolate, and atrophied fat body tissues were found in heavily infected larvae. Two types of spores were observed, diplokaroytic spores with 11–13 coils of polar tube, and monokaryotic spores with 12 coils of the polar tube that developed within a sporophorous vesicle to form octospores. Electron-dense granules were abundant in the episporontal space of the sporophorous vesicles, and were similar to those of Vairimorpha invictae isolated from Solenopsis invicta, but different from granules or inclusions of other Vairimorpha species. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the small subunit ribosomal DNA sequence, this isolate is unique within the Vairimorpha complex. Morphological and genetic characters showed this isolate to be a new species. It is placed in the genus Vairimorpha and is described as Vairimorpha ocinarae n. sp.",midgut epithelium; midgut muscle; Malphigian,midgut epithelium; midgut muscle; Malphigian,midgut epithelium; Malphigian; midgut muscle,atrophied fat body tissues; Malpighian tubules; tissues; midgut muscle; midgut epithelium,2,3,1
682,Vairimorpha plodiae,1,"First report and spore ultrastructure of Vairimorpha plodiae (Opisthokonta: Microspora) from Plodia interpunctella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) in Turkey ::: The present study describes the first isolation and characterization of Vairimorpha plodiae, a microsporidian pathogen of Plodia interpunctella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), from Turkey. We present characteristic light and electron microscopical features of the spores. Fresh binucleate spores are oval and measure 4.48 ± 0.23 (4.01–4.84) μm in length and 2.21 ± 0.15 (1.91–2.48) μm in width. Ultrastructural studies showed that the spore wall measures 150 to 200 nm and consists of a clear endospore (125–150 nm) and an electron-dense, uniform, thin exospore (30–50 nm). The polar filament is isofilar and with 10–12 coils. The well-developed polaroplast consists of two parts with thin lamellae anteriorly and thick, irregularly arranged lamellae posteriorly.

NIS M12, a microsporidian parasite isolated from the silkworm, Bombyx mori, successfully infected the cell line of Spodoptera frugiperda SF21AE II. After priming with 0.1N KOH solution, the spores were mixed thoroughly with S. frugiperda cells suspended in Rinaldini's solution. Inoculated cells were cultured at 28°C in IPL-41 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. At a ratio of 30 spores per cell, 9.1% of S. frugiperda cells were infected initially with sporoplasms 1hr postinoculation. About 65% of the infected cells harbored a single sporoplasm. The spread of infection and spore production of V. sp. NIS M12 in cell cultures were markedly different from those of Nosema bombycis, while the in vitro life cycles of the two parasites was similar. Short-coiled spores occurred 72hr postinoculation, and longcoiled mature spores were produced 10 days postinoculation.

(Microsporidia: Burnellidae) on Trichogramma chilonis (Hymenoptera, Trichogrammatidae), a hymenopteran parasitoid of the cabbage moth, Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera, Yponomeutidae) ::: A multi-generation mass breeding colony of the cabbage moth, Plutella xylostella, was found to be infected with a microsporidium, Vairimorpha sp., which is passed transovarially between generations. The microsporidian infection had little impact on the fitness of this lepidopteran pest. However, when Trichogramma chilonis parasitized such infected host eggs, the offspring of this parasitoid species suffered from severe deficiencies. Microsporidian spores, ingested by parasitoid larvae together with the host egg nutrients, gave rise to stages which developed in various tissues of the parasitoid, such as the flight muscle and the nervous system. This infection resulted in a significantly increased rate of metamorphosis failure (related to host age) and reduced longevity and reproductive performance of the parasitoids. There are two main consequences arising from our findings if T. chilonis is to be used in an integrated control strategy against P. xylostella: (1) T. chilonis must be raised on Vairimorpha-free host eggs to receive viable and efficaceous parasitoids for release and (2) if natural populations of the cabbage moth in cruciferous crops are infected with Vairimorpha to a significant extent, the parasitoid must be released repeatedly within infested crop areas.",flight muscles; nervous system; egg,flight muscles; nervous system; egg,egg; flight muscles; nervous system,cabbage moth; Plutella xylostella,0,2,3

Vavraia cyclocypris sp. n. — первая находка микроспоридий (Microsporida) из остракод (Ostracoda, Crustacea) ::: A new microsporidian parasite of a freshwater crustacean Cyclocypris ovum L. from the lake Vrevo in the Leningrad district is described by means of light and electron microscopy methods. Infected specimens were found in autumn in less than 1% of the population. Microsporidian parasites seem to develop in the connective tissue and fat cells. Numerous sporoblasts are formed by means of rosette-like budding of multinuclear sporont's plasmodium. The sporont's membrane is retained and it plays a pansporoblastic envelope role. The spores are oval-elongated, in freshwater smears measuring 3.4 (3.3-3.5) X 1.7 (1.6-1.8) μ. Exospore is two-layered, endospore is well developed. The anchoring disc has a typical form, the polaroblast is lamellary, occupying V4—V3 of the spore's volume. The polar filament is anisofilar and appears as 2—3 coils of the thick part, one intermediate coil and 4-6 coils of the thin part in a single layer. The spore is uninuclear. Preliminarily, the new microsporidian species is regarded as belonging to the genus Vavraia.",Adipose; connective tissue,Adipose; connective tissue,Adipose; connective tissue,specimens,0,1,2

(Phylum Microspora) infecting the sandfly Lutzomyia longipalpis (Psychodidae, Phlebotominae), a vector of human visceral leishmaniasis ::: Vavraia lutzomyiae (Microsporida; Pleistophoridae) is a new species parasitic in the tropical phlebotomine sandfly, Lutzomyia longipalpis (Diptera, Psychodidae, Phlebotominae), a major vector of Leishmania chagasi in Latin America where human visceral leishmaniasis is endemic. Infected larvae and pupae were parasitized in the abdomen, and some adults were parasitized in Malpighian tubules and midgut. The sporogonial plasmodium divided by multiple divisions into up to 64 uninucleate sporoblasts. These stages were surrounded outside the plasmalemma by a thick, amorphous dense coat and transformed into a merontogenetic sporophorous vesicle within which the sporonts developed into sporoblasts. The mature microsporidian spores were broadly ellipsoidal and measured 6.1+/-0.43x3.1+/-0.15μm. The spore wall consisted of a transparent endospore (~100nm) and a thin electron dense exospore (~30nm) with the outer limit slightly undulated. Spores contained a polar filament arranged peripherally in a single layer of eight to nine wide anterior coils (~125nm diameter), and three to four narrow posterior coils (~70nm diameter). Transverse sections revealed a concentric layer organization with the internal layer surrounded by numerous (up to 25) longitudinal microfibrils. The angle of tilt of the polar filament was about 65-68^o.",midgut; Malphigian,midgut; Malphigian,Malphigian; midgut,abdomen; Malpighian tubules,0,2,2
699,Zelenkaia trichopterae,1,"Description and phylogeny of Zelenkaia trichopterae gen. et sp. nov. (Microsporidia), an aquatic microsporidian parasite of caddisflies (Trichoptera) forming spore doublets ::: Two novel microsporidia infecting the fat body tissues in larvae of two hosts, Halesus digitatus and Micropterna sequax (Trichoptera, Limnephilidae), were investigated using light and electron microscopy and rDNA sequence analyses. The molecular and morphological characters of these isolates warrant creation of a new microsporidian genus, Zelenkaia gen. n., with two species, one named herein. Developmental stages of Zelenkaia spp. have single nuclei. In sporogony, a plasmodium with four nuclei gives rise by rosette-like budding to two pairs of uninucleate sporoblasts, each within a thin-walled, subpersistent sporophorous vesicle. Sporoblasts and mature spores adhere temporary together, forming doublets oriented in parallel, within the sporophorous vesicle. Spores are long-oval and uninucleate, and those of the type species Z. trichopterae measure 10.3×3.5μm and have 24–25 polar filament coils. Phylogenetic analysis based on rDNA places Zelenkaia spp. within the aquatic clade of microsporidia and, more specifically, in the clade containing some microporidia from amphipod hosts.",Adipose,Adipose,Adipose,fat body tissues; rDNA; spore doublets,0,3,1
